    "description": "A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.\n\nGiven a list of <code>stones</code>&nbsp;positions (in units) in sorted <strong>ascending order</strong>, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be <code>1</code> unit.\n\nIf the frog's last jump was <code>k</code> units, its next jump must be either <code>k - 1</code>, <code>k</code>, or <code>k + 1</code> units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.\n\n",
