    "description": "You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.\n\nSuppose you have <code>n</code> versions <code>[1, 2, ..., n]</code> and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.\n\nYou are given an API <code>bool isBadVersion(version)</code> which returns whether <code>version</code> is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.\n\n",
