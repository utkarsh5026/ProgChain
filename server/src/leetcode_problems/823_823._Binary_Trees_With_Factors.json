    "description": "Given an array of unique integers, <code>arr</code>, where each integer <code>arr[i]</code> is strictly greater than <code>1</code>.\n\nWe make a binary tree using these integers, and each number may be used for any number of times. Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of its children.\n\nReturn <em>the number of binary trees we can make</em>. The answer may be too large so return the answer <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
