    "description": "On an <code>2 x 3</code> board, there are five tiles labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>5</code>, and an empty square represented by <code>0</code>. A <strong>move</strong> consists of choosing <code>0</code> and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.\n\nThe state of the board is solved if and only if the board is <code>[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]</code>.\n\nGiven the puzzle board <code>board</code>, return <em>the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved</em>. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return <code>-1</code>.\n\n",
