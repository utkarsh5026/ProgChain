    "description": "We have a wooden plank of the length <code>n</code> <strong>units</strong>. Some ants are walking on the plank, each ant moves with a speed of <strong>1 unit per second</strong>. Some of the ants move to the <strong>left</strong>, the other move to the <strong>right</strong>.\n\nWhen two ants moving in two <strong>different</strong> directions meet at some point, they change their directions and continue moving again. Assume changing directions does not take any additional time.\n\nWhen an ant reaches <strong>one end</strong> of the plank at a time <code>t</code>, it falls out of the plank immediately.\n\nGiven an integer <code>n</code> and two integer arrays <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>, the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right, return <em>the moment when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank</em>.\n\n",
