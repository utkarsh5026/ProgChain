    "description": "Given a 2D array of characters <code>grid</code> of size <code>m x n</code>, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the <strong>same value</strong> in <code>grid</code>.\n\nA cycle is a path of <strong>length 4 or more</strong> in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the <strong>same value</strong> of the current cell.\n\nAlso, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle <code>(1, 1) -&gt; (1, 2) -&gt; (1, 1)</code> is invalid because from <code>(1, 2)</code> we visited <code>(1, 1)</code> which was the last visited cell.\n\nReturn <code>true</code> if any cycle of the same value exists in <code>grid</code>, otherwise, return <code>false</code>.\n\n",
