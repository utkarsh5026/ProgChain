Your task is to remove some bricks to form a <strong>mountain-shaped</strong> tower arrangement. In this arrangement, the tower heights are non-decreasing, reaching a maximum peak value with one or multiple consecutive towers and then non-increasing.\n\nReturn the <strong>maximum possible sum</strong> of heights of a mountain-shaped tower arrangement.\n\n",
