    "description": "A city's <strong>skyline</strong> is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return <em>the <strong>skyline</strong> formed by these buildings collectively</em>.\n\nThe geometric information of each building is given in the array <code>buildings</code> where <code>buildings[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>, height<sub>i</sub>]</code>:\n\nYou may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height <code>0</code>.\n\nThe <strong>skyline</strong> should be represented as a list of \"key points\" <strong>sorted by their x-coordinate</strong> in the form <code>[[x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>],[x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>],...]</code>. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate <code>0</code> and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.\n\n<b>Note:</b> There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, <code>[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]</code> is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: <code>[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]</code>\n\n",
