    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> array of strings <code>garbage</code> where <code>garbage[i]</code> represents the assortment of garbage at the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> house. <code>garbage[i]</code> consists only of the characters <code>'M'</code>, <code>'P'</code> and <code>'G'</code> representing one unit of metal, paper and glass garbage respectively. Picking up <strong>one</strong> unit of any type of garbage takes <code>1</code> minute.\n\nYou are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>travel</code> where <code>travel[i]</code> is the number of minutes needed to go from house <code>i</code> to house <code>i + 1</code>.\n\nThere are three garbage trucks in the city, each responsible for picking up one type of garbage. Each garbage truck starts at house <code>0</code> and must visit each house <strong>in order</strong>; however, they do <strong>not</strong> need to visit every house.\n\nOnly <strong>one</strong> garbage truck may be used at any given moment. While one truck is driving or picking up garbage, the other two trucks <strong>cannot</strong> do anything.\n\nReturn<em> the <strong>minimum</strong> number of minutes needed to pick up all the garbage.</em>\n\n",
