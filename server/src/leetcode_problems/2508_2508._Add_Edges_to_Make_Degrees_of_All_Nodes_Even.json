    "description": "There is an <strong>undirected</strong> graph consisting of <code>n</code> nodes numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You are given the integer <code>n</code> and a <strong>2D</strong> array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. The graph can be disconnected.\n\nYou can add <strong>at most</strong> two additional edges (possibly none) to this graph so that there are no repeated edges and no self-loops.\n\nReturn <code>true</code><em> if it is possible to make the degree of each node in the graph even, otherwise return </em><code>false</code><em>.</em>\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.\n\n",
