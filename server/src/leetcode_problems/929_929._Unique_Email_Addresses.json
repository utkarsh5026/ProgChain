    "description": "Every <strong>valid email</strong> consists of a <strong>local name</strong> and a <strong>domain name</strong>, separated by the <code>'@'</code> sign. Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more <code>'.'</code> or <code>'+'</code>.\n\nIf you add periods <code>'.'</code> between some characters in the <strong>local name</strong> part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Note that this rule <strong>does not apply</strong> to <strong>domain names</strong>.\n\nIf you add a plus <code>'+'</code> in the <strong>local name</strong>, everything after the first plus sign <strong>will be ignored</strong>. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule <strong>does not apply</strong> to <strong>domain names</strong>.\n\nIt is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.\n\nGiven an array of strings <code>emails</code> where we send one email to each <code>emails[i]</code>, return <em>the number of different addresses that actually receive mails</em>.\n\n",
