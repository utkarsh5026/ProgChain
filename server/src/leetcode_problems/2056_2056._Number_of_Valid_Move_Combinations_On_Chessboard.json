    "description": "There is an <code>8 x 8</code> chessboard containing <code>n</code> pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array <code>pieces</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>pieces[i]</code> describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array <code>positions</code> also of length <code>n</code>, where <code>positions[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> piece is currently at the <strong>1-based</strong> coordinate <code>(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)</code> on the chessboard.\n\nWhen making a <strong>move</strong> for a piece, you choose a <strong>destination</strong> square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.\n\nYou must make a <strong>move</strong> for every piece on the board simultaneously. A <strong>move combination</strong> consists of all the <strong>moves</strong> performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel <strong>one square</strong> towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> second. A move combination is <strong>invalid</strong> if, at a given time, <strong>two or more</strong> pieces occupy the same square.\n\nReturn <em>the number of <strong>valid</strong> move combinations</em>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\n<strong>Notes:</strong>\n\n",
