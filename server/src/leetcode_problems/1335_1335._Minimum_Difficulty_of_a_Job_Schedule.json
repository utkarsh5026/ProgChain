    "description": "You want to schedule a list of jobs in <code>d</code> days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job, you have to finish all the jobs <code>j</code> where <code>0 &lt;= j &lt; i</code>).\n\nYou have to finish <strong>at least</strong> one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the <code>d</code> days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.\n\nYou are given an integer array <code>jobDifficulty</code> and an integer <code>d</code>. The difficulty of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job is <code>jobDifficulty[i]</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum difficulty of a job schedule</em>. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return <code>-1</code>.\n\n",
