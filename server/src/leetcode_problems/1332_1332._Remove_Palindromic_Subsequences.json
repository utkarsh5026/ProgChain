In a single step you can remove one <strong>palindromic subsequence</strong> from <code>s</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of steps to make the given string empty</em>.\n\nA string is a <strong>subsequence</strong> of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does <strong>not</strong> necessarily need to be contiguous.\n\nA string is called <strong>palindrome</strong> if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.\n\n",
