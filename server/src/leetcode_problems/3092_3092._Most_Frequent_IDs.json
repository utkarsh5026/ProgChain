    "description": "The problem involves tracking the frequency of IDs in a collection that changes over time. You have two integer arrays, <code>nums</code> and <code>freq</code>, of equal length <code>n</code>. Each element in <code>nums</code> represents an ID, and the corresponding element in <code>freq</code> indicates how many times that ID should be added to or removed from the collection at each step.\n\nReturn an array <code>ans</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>ans[i]</code> represents the <strong>count</strong> of the <em>most frequent ID</em> in the collection after the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code>&nbsp;step. If the collection is empty at any step, <code>ans[i]</code> should be 0 for that step.\n\n",
