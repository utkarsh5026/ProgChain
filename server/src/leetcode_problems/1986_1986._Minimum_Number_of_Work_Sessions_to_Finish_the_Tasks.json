The task times are represented as an integer array <code>tasks</code> of length <code>n</code>, where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> task takes <code>tasks[i]</code> hours to finish. A <strong>work session</strong> is when you work for <strong>at most</strong> <code>sessionTime</code> consecutive hours and then take a break.\n\nYou should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nGiven <code>tasks</code> and <code>sessionTime</code>, return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of <strong>work sessions</strong> needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above.</em>\n\nThe tests are generated such that <code>sessionTime</code> is <strong>greater</strong> than or <strong>equal</strong> to the <strong>maximum</strong> element in <code>tasks[i]</code>.\n\n",
