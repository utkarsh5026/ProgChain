    "description": "Given an array of integers <code>arr</code>, sort the array by performing a series of <strong>pancake flips</strong>.\n\nIn one pancake flip we do the following steps:\n\nFor example, if <code>arr = [3,2,1,4]</code> and we performed a pancake flip choosing <code>k = 3</code>, we reverse the sub-array <code>[3,2,1]</code>, so <code>arr = [<u>1</u>,<u>2</u>,<u>3</u>,4]</code> after the pancake flip at <code>k = 3</code>.\n\nReturn <em>an array of the </em><code>k</code><em>-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort </em><code>arr</code>. Any valid answer that sorts the array within <code>10 * arr.length</code> flips will be judged as correct.\n\n",
