    "description": "You have a movie renting company consisting of <code>n</code> shops. You want to implement a renting system that supports searching for, booking, and returning movies. The system should also support generating a report of the currently rented movies.\n\nEach movie is given as a 2D integer array <code>entries</code> where <code>entries[i] = [shop<sub>i</sub>, movie<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a copy of movie <code>movie<sub>i</sub></code> at shop <code>shop<sub>i</sub></code> with a rental price of <code>price<sub>i</sub></code>. Each shop carries <strong>at most one</strong> copy of a movie <code>movie<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nThe system should support the following functions:\n\nImplement the <code>MovieRentingSystem</code> class:\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> The test cases will be generated such that <code>rent</code> will only be called if the shop has an <strong>unrented</strong> copy of the movie, and <code>drop</code> will only be called if the shop had <strong>previously rented</strong> out the movie.\n\n",
