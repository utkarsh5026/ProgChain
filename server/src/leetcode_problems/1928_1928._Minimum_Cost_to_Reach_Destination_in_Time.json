    "description": "There is a country of <code>n</code> cities numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> where <strong>all the cities are connected</strong> by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes a road between cities <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> that takes <code>time<sub>i</sub></code> minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.\n\nEach time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>passingFees</code> of length <code>n</code> where <code>passingFees[j]</code> is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city <code>j</code>.\n\nIn the beginning, you are at city <code>0</code> and want to reach city <code>n - 1</code> in <code>maxTime</code><strong> minutes or less</strong>. The <strong>cost</strong> of your journey is the <strong>summation of passing fees</strong> for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (<strong>including</strong> the source and destination cities).\n\nGiven <code>maxTime</code>, <code>edges</code>, and <code>passingFees</code>, return <em>the <strong>minimum cost</strong> to complete your journey, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if you cannot complete it within </em><code>maxTime</code><em> minutes</em>.\n\n",
