    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m x n</code> binary matrix <code>grid</code>.\n\nLet us call a <strong>non-empty</strong> subset of rows <strong>good</strong> if the sum of each column of the subset is at most half of the length of the subset.\n\nMore formally, if the length of the chosen subset of rows is <code>k</code>, then the sum of each column should be at most <code>floor(k / 2)</code>.\n\nReturn <em>an integer array that contains row indices of a good subset sorted in <strong>ascending</strong> order.</em>\n\nIf there are multiple good subsets, you can return any of them. If there are no good subsets, return an empty array.\n\nA <strong>subset</strong> of rows of the matrix <code>grid</code> is any matrix that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) rows from <code>grid</code>.\n\n",
