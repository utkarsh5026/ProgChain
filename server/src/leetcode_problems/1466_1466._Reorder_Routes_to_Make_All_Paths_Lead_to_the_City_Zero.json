    "description": "There are <code>n</code> cities numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> and <code>n - 1</code> roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.\n\nRoads are represented by <code>connections</code> where <code>connections[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a road from city <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> to city <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nThis year, there will be a big event in the capital (city <code>0</code>), and many people want to travel to this city.\n\nYour task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city <code>0</code>. Return the <strong>minimum</strong> number of edges changed.\n\nIt's <strong>guaranteed</strong> that each city can reach city <code>0</code> after reorder.\n\n",
