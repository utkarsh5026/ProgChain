    "description": "You have an <code>inventory</code> of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants <code>orders</code> balls of <strong>any</strong> color.\n\nThe customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls <strong>of that color&nbsp;</strong>you currently have in your <code>inventory</code>. For example, if you own <code>6</code> yellow balls, the customer would pay <code>6</code> for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only <code>5</code> yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at <code>5</code> (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).\n\nYou are given an integer array, <code>inventory</code>, where <code>inventory[i]</code> represents the number of balls of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> color that you initially own. You are also given an integer <code>orders</code>, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls <strong>in any order</strong>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> total value that you can attain after selling </em><code>orders</code><em> colored balls</em>. As the answer may be too large, return it <strong>modulo </strong><code>10<sup>9 </sup>+ 7</code>.\n\n",
