    "description": "You are given a license key represented as a string <code>s</code> that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into <code>n + 1</code> groups by <code>n</code> dashes. You are also given an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nWe want to reformat the string <code>s</code> such that each group contains exactly <code>k</code> characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than <code>k</code> but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.\n\nReturn <em>the reformatted license key</em>.\n\n",
