    "description": "<code>RandomizedCollection</code> is a data structure that contains a collection of numbers, possibly duplicates (i.e., a multiset). It should support inserting and removing specific elements and also reporting a random element.\n\nImplement the <code>RandomizedCollection</code> class:\n\nYou must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on <strong>average</strong> <code>O(1)</code> time complexity.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> The test cases are generated such that <code>getRandom</code> will only be called if there is <strong>at least one</strong> item in the <code>RandomizedCollection</code>.\n\n",
