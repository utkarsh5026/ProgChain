    "description": "A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is <code>target</code> miles east of the starting position.\n\nThere are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array <code>stations</code> where <code>stations[i] = [position<sub>i</sub>, fuel<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> gas station is <code>position<sub>i</sub></code> miles east of the starting position and has <code>fuel<sub>i</sub></code> liters of gas.\n\nThe car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has <code>startFuel</code> liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination</em>. If it cannot reach the destination, return <code>-1</code>.\n\nNote that if the car reaches a gas station with <code>0</code> fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with <code>0</code> fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.\n\n",
