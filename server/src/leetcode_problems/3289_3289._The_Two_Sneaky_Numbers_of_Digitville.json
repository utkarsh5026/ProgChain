    "description": "In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called <code>nums</code> containing integers from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. Each number was supposed to appear <strong>exactly once</strong> in the list, however, <strong>two</strong> mischievous numbers sneaked in an <em>additional time</em>, making the list longer than usual.\n\nAs the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an array of size <strong>two</strong> containing the two numbers (in <em>any order</em>), so peace can return to Digitville.\n\n",
