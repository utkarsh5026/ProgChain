You are given an integer array <code>height</code> where <code>height[i]</code> represents the height of mountain <code>i</code>, and an integer <code>threshold</code>.\n\nA mountain is called <strong>stable</strong> if the mountain just before it (<strong>if it exists</strong>) has a height <strong>strictly greater</strong> than <code>threshold</code>. <strong>Note</strong> that mountain 0 is <strong>not</strong> stable.\n\nReturn an array containing the indices of <em>all</em> <strong>stable</strong> mountains in <strong>any</strong> order.\n\n",
