    "description": "You are given a 2D integer array <code>orders</code>, where each <code>orders[i] = [price<sub>i</sub>, amount<sub>i</sub>, orderType<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that <code>amount<sub>i</sub></code><sub> </sub>orders have been placed of type <code>orderType<sub>i</sub></code> at the price <code>price<sub>i</sub></code>. The <code>orderType<sub>i</sub></code> is:\n\nNote that <code>orders[i]</code> represents a batch of <code>amount<sub>i</sub></code> independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by <code>orders[i]</code> will be placed before all orders represented by <code>orders[i+1]</code> for all valid <code>i</code>.\n\nThere is a <strong>backlog</strong> that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:\n\nReturn <em>the total <strong>amount</strong> of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input</em>. Since this number can be large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
