    "description": "There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for <code>n</code> minutes. You are given an integer array <code>customers</code> of length <code>n</code> where <code>customers[i]</code> is the number of the customers that enter the store at the start of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.\n\nDuring certain minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array grumpy where <code>grumpy[i]</code> is <code>1</code> if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> minute, and is <code>0</code> otherwise.\n\nWhen the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers entering during that minute are not <strong>satisfied</strong>. Otherwise, they are satisfied.\n\nThe bookstore owner knows a secret technique to remain <strong>not grumpy</strong> for <code>minutes</code> consecutive minutes, but this technique can only be used <strong>once</strong>.\n\nReturn the <strong>maximum</strong> number of customers that can be <em>satisfied</em> throughout the day.\n\n",
