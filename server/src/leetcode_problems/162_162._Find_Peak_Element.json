    "description": "A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.\n\nGiven a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>nums</code>, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to <strong>any of the peaks</strong>.\n\nYou may imagine that <code>nums[-1] = nums[n] = -\u221e</code>. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in <code>O(log n)</code> time.\n\n",
