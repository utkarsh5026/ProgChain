    "description": "You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has <strong>two</strong> main properties: <strong>attack</strong> and <strong>defense</strong>. You are given a 2D integer array <code>properties</code> where <code>properties[i] = [attack<sub>i</sub>, defense<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the properties of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> character in the game.\n\nA character is said to be <strong>weak</strong> if any other character has <strong>both</strong> attack and defense levels <strong>strictly greater</strong> than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character <code>i</code> is said to be <strong>weak</strong> if there exists another character <code>j</code> where <code>attack<sub>j</sub> &gt; attack<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>defense<sub>j</sub> &gt; defense<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nReturn <em>the number of <strong>weak</strong> characters</em>.\n\n",
