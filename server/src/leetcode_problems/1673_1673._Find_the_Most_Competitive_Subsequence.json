    "description": "Given an integer array <code>nums</code> and a positive integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the most<strong> competitive</strong> subsequence of </em><code>nums</code> <em>of size </em><code>k</code>.\n\nAn array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.\n\nWe define that a subsequence <code>a</code> is more <strong>competitive</strong> than a subsequence <code>b</code> (of the same length) if in the first position where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> differ, subsequence <code>a</code> has a number <strong>less</strong> than the corresponding number in <code>b</code>. For example, <code>[1,3,4]</code> is more competitive than <code>[1,3,5]</code> because the first position they differ is at the final number, and <code>4</code> is less than <code>5</code>.\n\n",
