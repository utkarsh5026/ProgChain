    "description": "There are <code>n</code> rooms you need to visit, labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. Each day is labeled, starting from <code>0</code>. You will go in and visit one room a day.\n\nInitially on day <code>0</code>, you visit room <code>0</code>. The <strong>order</strong> you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following <strong>rules</strong> and a given <strong>0-indexed</strong> array <code>nextVisit</code> of length <code>n</code>:\n\nReturn <em>the label of the <strong>first</strong> day where you have been in <strong>all</strong> the rooms</em>. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
