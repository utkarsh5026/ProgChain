    "description": "You are given a <strong>directed</strong> graph of <code>n</code> nodes numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>, where each node has <strong>at most one</strong> outgoing edge.\n\nThe graph is represented with a given <strong>0-indexed</strong> array <code>edges</code> of size <code>n</code>, indicating that there is a directed edge from node <code>i</code> to node <code>edges[i]</code>. If there is no outgoing edge from <code>i</code>, then <code>edges[i] == -1</code>.\n\nYou are also given two integers <code>node1</code> and <code>node2</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>index</strong> of the node that can be reached from both </em><code>node1</code><em> and </em><code>node2</code><em>, such that the <strong>maximum</strong> between the distance from </em><code>node1</code><em> to that node, and from </em><code>node2</code><em> to that node is <strong>minimized</strong></em>. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the <strong>smallest</strong> index, and if no possible answer exists, return <code>-1</code>.\n\nNote that <code>edges</code> may contain cycles.\n\n",
