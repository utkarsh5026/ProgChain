    "description": "Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.\n\nThe encoding rule is: <code>k[encoded_string]</code>, where the <code>encoded_string</code> inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly <code>k</code> times. Note that <code>k</code> is guaranteed to be a positive integer.\n\nYou may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, <code>k</code>. For example, there will not be input like <code>3a</code> or <code>2[4]</code>.\n\nThe test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed <code>10<sup>5</sup></code>.\n\n",
