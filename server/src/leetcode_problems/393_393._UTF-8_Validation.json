    "description": "Given an integer array <code>data</code> representing the data, return whether it is a valid <strong>UTF-8</strong> encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).\n\nA character in <strong>UTF8</strong> can be from <strong>1 to 4 bytes</strong> long, subjected to the following rules:\n\nThis is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:\n\n<code>x</code> denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.\n\n<strong>Note: </strong>The input is an array of integers. Only the <strong>least significant 8 bits</strong> of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.\n\n",
