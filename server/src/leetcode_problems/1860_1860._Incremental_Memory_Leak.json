    "description": "You are given two integers <code>memory1</code> and <code>memory2</code> representing the available memory in bits on two memory sticks. There is currently a faulty program running that consumes an increasing amount of memory every second.\n\nAt the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> second (starting from 1), <code>i</code> bits of memory are allocated to the stick with <strong>more available memory</strong> (or from the first memory stick if both have the same available memory). If neither stick has at least <code>i</code> bits of available memory, the program <strong>crashes</strong>.\n\nReturn <em>an array containing </em><code>[crashTime, memory1<sub>crash</sub>, memory2<sub>crash</sub>]</code><em>, where </em><code>crashTime</code><em> is the time (in seconds) when the program crashed and </em><code>memory1<sub>crash</sub></code><em> and </em><code>memory2<sub>crash</sub></code><em> are the available bits of memory in the first and second sticks respectively</em>.\n\n",
