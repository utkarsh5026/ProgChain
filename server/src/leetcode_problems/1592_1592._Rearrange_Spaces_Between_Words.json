    "description": "You are given a string <code>text</code> of words that are placed among some number of spaces. Each word consists of one or more lowercase English letters and are separated by at least one space. It's guaranteed that <code>text</code> <strong>contains at least one word</strong>.\n\nRearrange the spaces so that there is an <strong>equal</strong> number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is <strong>maximized</strong>. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the <strong>extra spaces at the end</strong>, meaning the returned string should be the same length as <code>text</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the string after rearranging the spaces</em>.\n\n",
