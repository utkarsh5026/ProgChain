    "description": "You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an <code>m x n</code> matrix. In this matrix:\n\nIn one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.\n\nYou must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes <code>1</code> (an empty cell).\n\nStarting from the point <code>(0, 0)</code>, return <em>the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees</em>. If you cannot cut off all the trees, return <code>-1</code>.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> The input is generated such that no two trees have the same height, and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.\n\n",
