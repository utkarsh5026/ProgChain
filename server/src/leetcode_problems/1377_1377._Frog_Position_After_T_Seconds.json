    "description": "Given an undirected tree consisting of <code>n</code> vertices numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. A frog starts jumping from <strong>vertex 1</strong>. In one second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another <strong>unvisited</strong> vertex if they are directly connected. The frog can not jump back to a visited vertex. In case the frog can jump to several vertices, it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability. Otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex, it jumps forever on the same vertex.\n\nThe edges of the undirected tree are given in the array <code>edges</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that exists an edge connecting the vertices <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\n<em>Return the probability that after <code>t</code> seconds the frog is on the vertex <code>target</code>. </em>Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer will be accepted.\n\n",
