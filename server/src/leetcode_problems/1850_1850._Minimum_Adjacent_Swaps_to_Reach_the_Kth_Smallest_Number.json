There can be many wonderful integers. However, we only care about the <strong>smallest-valued</strong> ones.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum number of adjacent digit swaps</strong> that needs to be applied to </em><code>num</code><em> to reach the </em><code>k<sup>th</sup></code><em><strong> smallest wonderful</strong> integer</em>.\n\nThe tests are generated in such a way that <code>k<sup>th</sup></code>&nbsp;smallest wonderful integer exists.\n\n",
