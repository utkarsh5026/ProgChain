    "description": "For a binary tree <strong>T</strong>, we can define a <strong>flip operation</strong> as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.\n\nA binary tree <strong>X</strong>&nbsp;is <em>flip equivalent</em> to a binary tree <strong>Y</strong> if and only if we can make <strong>X</strong> equal to <strong>Y</strong> after some number of flip operations.\n\nGiven the roots of two binary trees <code>root1</code> and <code>root2</code>, return <code>true</code> if the two trees are flip equivalent or <code>false</code> otherwise.\n\n",
