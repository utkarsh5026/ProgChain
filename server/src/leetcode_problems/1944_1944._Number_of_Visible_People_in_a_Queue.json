    "description": "There are <code>n</code> people standing in a queue, and they numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> in <strong>left to right</strong> order. You are given an array <code>heights</code> of <strong>distinct</strong> integers where <code>heights[i]</code> represents the height of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person.\n\nA person can <strong>see</strong> another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is <strong>shorter</strong> than both of them. More formally, the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person can see the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> person if <code>i &lt; j</code> and <code>min(heights[i], heights[j]) &gt; max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])</code>.\n\nReturn <em>an array </em><code>answer</code><em> of length </em><code>n</code><em> where </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> is the <strong>number of people</strong> the </em><code>i<sup>th</sup></code><em> person can <strong>see</strong> to their right in the queue</em>.\n\n",
