    "description": "You are given an <code>m x n</code> integer array <code>grid</code>. There is a robot initially located at the <b>top-left corner</b> (i.e., <code>grid[0][0]</code>). The robot tries to move to the <strong>bottom-right corner</strong> (i.e., <code>grid[m - 1][n - 1]</code>). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n\nAn obstacle and space are marked as <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> respectively in <code>grid</code>. A path that the robot takes cannot include <strong>any</strong> square that is an obstacle.\n\nReturn <em>the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner</em>.\n\nThe testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to <code>2 * 10<sup>9</sup></code>.\n\n",
