    "description": "You are given an array <code>time</code> where <code>time[i]</code> denotes the time taken by the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bus to complete <strong>one trip</strong>.\n\nEach bus can make multiple trips <strong>successively</strong>; that is, the next trip can start <strong>immediately after</strong> completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates <strong>independently</strong>; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.\n\nYou are also given an integer <code>totalTrips</code>, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make <strong>in total</strong>. Return <em>the <strong>minimum time</strong> required for all buses to complete <strong>at least</strong> </em><code>totalTrips</code><em> trips</em>.\n\n",
