    "description": "You have <code>n</code> packages that you are trying to place in boxes, <strong>one package in each box</strong>. There are <code>m</code> suppliers that each produce boxes of <strong>different sizes</strong> (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is <strong>less than or equal to</strong> the size of the box.\n\nThe package sizes are given as an integer array <code>packages</code>, where <code>packages[i]</code> is the <strong>size</strong> of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array <code>boxes</code>, where <code>boxes[j]</code> is an array of <strong>box sizes</strong> that the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> supplier produces.\n\nYou want to choose a <strong>single supplier</strong> and use boxes from them such that the <strong>total wasted space </strong>is <strong>minimized</strong>. For each package in a box, we define the space <strong>wasted</strong> to be <code>size of the box - size of the package</code>. The <strong>total wasted space</strong> is the sum of the space wasted in <strong>all</strong> the boxes.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum total wasted space</strong> by choosing the box supplier <strong>optimally</strong>, or </em><code>-1</code> <i>if it is <strong>impossible</strong> to fit all the packages inside boxes. </i>Since the answer may be <strong>large</strong>, return it <strong>modulo </strong><code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
