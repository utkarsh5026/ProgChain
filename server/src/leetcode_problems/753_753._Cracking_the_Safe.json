    "description": "There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of <code>n</code> digits where each digit can be in the range <code>[0, k - 1]</code>.\n\nThe safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the <strong>most recent </strong><code>n</code><strong> digits</strong> that were entered each time you type a digit.\n\nReturn <em>any string of <strong>minimum length</strong> that will unlock the safe <strong>at some point</strong> of entering it</em>.\n\n",
