We call a string <code>t</code> <strong>ideal</strong> if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\nReturn <em>the length of the <strong>longest</strong> ideal string</em>.\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet order of <code>'a'</code> and <code>'z'</code> is <code>25</code>, not <code>1</code>.\n\n",
