    "description": "You are an ant tasked with adding <code>n</code> new rooms numbered <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code> to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array of length <code>n</code>, <code>prevRoom</code>, where <code>prevRoom[i]</code> indicates that you must build room <code>prevRoom[i]</code> before building room <code>i</code>, and these two rooms must be connected <strong>directly</strong>. Room <code>0</code> is already built, so <code>prevRoom[0] = -1</code>. The expansion&nbsp;plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room <code>0</code>.\n\nYou can only build <strong>one room</strong> at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have <strong>already built</strong> only if they are <strong>connected</strong>.&nbsp;You can choose to build <strong>any room</strong> as long as its <strong>previous room</strong>&nbsp;is already built.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>number of different orders</strong> you can build all the rooms in</em>. Since the answer may be large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
