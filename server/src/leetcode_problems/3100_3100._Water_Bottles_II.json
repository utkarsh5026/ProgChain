In one operation, you can perform one of the following operations:\n\nNote that you cannot exchange multiple batches of empty bottles for the same value of <code>numExchange</code>. For example, if <code>numBottles == 3</code> and <code>numExchange == 1</code>, you cannot exchange <code>3</code> empty water bottles for <code>3</code> full bottles.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of water bottles you can drink</em>.\n\n",
