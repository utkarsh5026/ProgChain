    "description": "Given the integers <code>zero</code>, <code>one</code>, <code>low</code>, and <code>high</code>, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:\n\nThis can be performed any number of times.\n\nA <strong>good</strong> string is a string constructed by the above process having a <strong>length</strong> between <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>).\n\nReturn <em>the number of <strong>different</strong> good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties.</em> Since the answer can be large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
