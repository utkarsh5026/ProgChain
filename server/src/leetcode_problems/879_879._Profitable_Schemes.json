    "description": "There is a group of <code>n</code> members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> crime generates a <code>profit[i]</code> and requires <code>group[i]</code> members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.\n\nLet's call a <strong>profitable scheme</strong> any subset of these crimes that generates at least <code>minProfit</code> profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most <code>n</code>.\n\nReturn the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, <strong>return it modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
