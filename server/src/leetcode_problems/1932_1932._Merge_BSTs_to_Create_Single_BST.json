    "description": "You are given <code>n</code> <strong>BST (binary search tree) root nodes</strong> for <code>n</code> separate BSTs stored in an array <code>trees</code> (<strong>0-indexed</strong>). Each BST in <code>trees</code> has <strong>at most 3 nodes</strong>, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:\n\nReturn<em> the <strong>root</strong> of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing </em><code>n - 1</code><em> operations, or</em><em> </em><code>null</code> <i>if it is impossible to create a valid BST</i>.\n\nA BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the following property:\n\nA leaf is a node that has no children.\n\n",
