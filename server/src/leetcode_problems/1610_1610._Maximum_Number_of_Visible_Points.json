    "description": "You are given an array <code>points</code>, an integer <code>angle</code>, and your <code>location</code>, where <code>location = [pos<sub>x</sub>, pos<sub>y</sub>]</code> and <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> both denote <strong>integral coordinates</strong> on the X-Y plane.\n\nInitially, you are facing directly east from your position. You <strong>cannot move</strong> from your position, but you can <strong>rotate</strong>. In other words, <code>pos<sub>x</sub></code> and <code>pos<sub>y</sub></code> cannot be changed. Your field of view in <strong>degrees</strong> is represented by <code>angle</code>, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let <code>d</code> be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the <strong>inclusive</strong> range of angles <code>[d - angle/2, d + angle/2]</code>.\n\n\n<video autoplay=\"\" controls=\"\" height=\"360\" width=\"480\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\"><source src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/30/angle.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag or this video format.</video>\n\n\nYou can <strong>see</strong> some set of points if, for each point, the <strong>angle</strong> formed by the point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position is <strong>in your field of view</strong>.\n\nThere can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.\n\nReturn <em>the maximum number of points you can see</em>.\n\n",
