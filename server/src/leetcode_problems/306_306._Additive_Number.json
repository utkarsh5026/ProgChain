    "description": "An <strong>additive number</strong> is a string whose digits can form an <strong>additive sequence</strong>.\n\nA valid <strong>additive sequence</strong> should contain <strong>at least</strong> three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.\n\nGiven a string containing only digits, return <code>true</code> if it is an <strong>additive number</strong> or <code>false</code> otherwise.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> Numbers in the additive sequence <strong>cannot</strong> have leading zeros, so sequence <code>1, 2, 03</code> or <code>1, 02, 3</code> is invalid.\n\n",
