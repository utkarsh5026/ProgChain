    "description": "You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of <code>n</code> monsters. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>dist</code> of size <code>n</code>, where <code>dist[i]</code> is the <strong>initial distance</strong> in kilometers of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> monster from the city.\n\nThe monsters walk toward the city at a <strong>constant</strong> speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array <code>speed</code> of size <code>n</code>, where <code>speed[i]</code> is the speed of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> monster in kilometers per minute.\n\nYou have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a <strong>single</strong> monster. However, the weapon takes <strong>one minute</strong> to charge. The weapon is fully charged at the very start.\n\nYou lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a <strong>loss</strong>, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or </em><code>n</code><em> if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.</em>\n\n",
