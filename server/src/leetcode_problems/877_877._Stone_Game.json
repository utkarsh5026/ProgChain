    "description": "Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an <strong>even</strong> number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a <strong>positive</strong> integer number of stones <code>piles[i]</code>.\n\nThe objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The <strong>total</strong> number of stones across all the piles is <strong>odd</strong>, so there are no ties.\n\nAlice and Bob take turns, with <strong>Alice starting first</strong>. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the <strong>beginning</strong> or from the <strong>end</strong> of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the <strong>most stones wins</strong>.\n\nAssuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return <code>true</code><em> if Alice wins the game, or </em><code>false</code><em> if Bob wins</em>.\n\n",
