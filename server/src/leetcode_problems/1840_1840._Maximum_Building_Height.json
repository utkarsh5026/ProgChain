The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.\n\nHowever, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:\n\nAdditionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array <code>restrictions</code> where <code>restrictions[i] = [id<sub>i</sub>, maxHeight<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that building <code>id<sub>i</sub></code> must have a height <strong>less than or equal to</strong> <code>maxHeight<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nIt is guaranteed that each building will appear <strong>at most once</strong> in <code>restrictions</code>, and building <code>1</code> will <strong>not</strong> be in <code>restrictions</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum possible height</strong> of the <strong>tallest</strong> building</em>.\n\n",
