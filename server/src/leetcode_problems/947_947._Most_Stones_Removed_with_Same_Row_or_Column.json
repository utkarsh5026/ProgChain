Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.\n\nA stone can be removed if it shares either <strong>the same row or the same column</strong> as another stone that has not been removed.\n\nGiven an array <code>stones</code> of length <code>n</code> where <code>stones[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the location of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> stone, return <em>the largest possible number of stones that can be removed</em>.\n\n",
