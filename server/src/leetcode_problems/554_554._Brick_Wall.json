    "description": "There is a rectangular brick wall in front of you with <code>n</code> rows of bricks. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> row has some number of bricks each of the same height (i.e., one unit) but they can be of different widths. The total width of each row is the same.\n\nDraw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks. If your line goes through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.\n\nGiven the 2D array <code>wall</code> that contains the information about the wall, return <em>the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing such a vertical line</em>.\n\n",
