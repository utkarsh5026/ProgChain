    "description": "There are <code>n</code> students in a class numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number <code>0</code>, then the student number <code>1</code>, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number <code>n - 1</code>. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number <code>0</code> again.\n\nYou are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>chalk</code> and an integer <code>k</code>. There are initially <code>k</code> pieces of chalk. When the student number <code>i</code> is given a problem to solve, they will use <code>chalk[i]</code> pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is <strong>strictly less</strong> than <code>chalk[i]</code>, then the student number <code>i</code> will be asked to <strong>replace</strong> the chalk.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>index</strong> of the student that will <strong>replace</strong> the chalk pieces</em>.\n\n",
