    "description": "You are given two integers <code>n</code> and <code>k</code> and two integer arrays <code>speed</code> and <code>efficiency</code> both of length <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> engineers numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. <code>speed[i]</code> and <code>efficiency[i]</code> represent the speed and efficiency of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> engineer respectively.\n\nChoose <strong>at most</strong> <code>k</code> different engineers out of the <code>n</code> engineers to form a team with the maximum <strong>performance</strong>.\n\nThe performance of a team is the sum of its engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among its engineers.\n\nReturn <em>the maximum performance of this team</em>. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
