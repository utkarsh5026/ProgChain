Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3]&nbsp;and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case&nbsp;on which an aisle split&nbsp;a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split&nbsp;a four-person group in the middle,&nbsp;which means to have two people on each side.\n\n",
