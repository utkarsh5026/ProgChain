If you buy the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to <code>prices[j]</code> where <code>j</code> is the minimum index such that <code>j &gt; i</code> and <code>prices[j] &lt;= prices[i]</code>. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.\n\nReturn an integer array <code>answer</code> where <code>answer[i]</code> is the final price you will pay for the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item of the shop, considering the special discount.\n\n",
