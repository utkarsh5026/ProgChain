    "description": "There is a directed graph of <code>n</code> nodes with each node labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. The graph is represented by a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>graph</code> where <code>graph[i]</code> is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node <code>i</code>, meaning there is an edge from node <code>i</code> to each node in <code>graph[i]</code>.\n\nA node is a <strong>terminal node</strong> if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a <strong>safe node</strong> if every possible path starting from that node leads to a <strong>terminal node</strong> (or another safe node).\n\nReturn <em>an array containing all the <strong>safe nodes</strong> of the graph</em>. The answer should be sorted in <strong>ascending</strong> order.\n\n",
