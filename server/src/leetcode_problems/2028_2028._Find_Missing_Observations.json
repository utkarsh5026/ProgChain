    "description": "You have observations of <code>n + m</code> <strong>6-sided</strong> dice rolls with each face numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>6</code>. <code>n</code> of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of <code>m</code> rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the <strong>average value</strong> of the <code>n + m</code> rolls.\n\nYou are given an integer array <code>rolls</code> of length <code>m</code> where <code>rolls[i]</code> is the value of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> observation. You are also given the two integers <code>mean</code> and <code>n</code>.\n\nReturn <em>an array of length </em><code>n</code><em> containing the missing observations such that the <strong>average value </strong>of the </em><code>n + m</code><em> rolls is <strong>exactly</strong> </em><code>mean</code>. If there are multiple valid answers, return <em>any of them</em>. If no such array exists, return <em>an empty array</em>.\n\nThe <strong>average value</strong> of a set of <code>k</code> numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by <code>k</code>.\n\nNote that <code>mean</code> is an integer, so the sum of the <code>n + m</code> rolls should be divisible by <code>n + m</code>.\n\n",
