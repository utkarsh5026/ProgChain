    "description": "There are <code>n</code> friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> in <strong>clockwise order</strong>. More formally, moving clockwise from the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> friend brings you to the <code>(i+1)<sup>th</sup></code> friend for <code>1 &lt;= i &lt; n</code>, and moving clockwise from the <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> friend brings you to the <code>1<sup>st</sup></code> friend.\n\nThe rules of the game are as follows:\n\n<code>1<sup>st</sup></code> friend receives the ball.\n\nIn other words, on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it to the friend who is <code>i * k</code> steps away from them in the <strong>clockwise</strong> direction.\n\nThe game is finished when some friend receives the ball for the second time.\n\nThe <strong>losers</strong> of the game are friends who did not receive the ball in the entire game.\n\nGiven the number of friends, <code>n</code>, and an integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the array answer, which contains the losers of the game in the <strong>ascending</strong> order</em>.\n\n",
