    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string array <code>words</code>, where <code>words[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.\n\nIn one operation, select any index <code>i</code> such that <code>0 &lt; i &lt; words.length</code> and <code>words[i - 1]</code> and <code>words[i]</code> are <strong>anagrams</strong>, and <strong>delete</strong> <code>words[i]</code> from <code>words</code>. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.\n\nReturn <code>words</code> <em>after performing all operations</em>. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in <strong>any</strong> arbitrary order will lead to the same result.\n\nAn <strong>Anagram</strong> is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, <code>\"dacb\"</code> is an anagram of <code>\"abdc\"</code>.\n\n",
