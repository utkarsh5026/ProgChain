    "description": "You have a 2-D <code>grid</code> of size <code>m x n</code> representing a box, and you have <code>n</code> balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.\n\nEach cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.\n\nWe drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a \"V\" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.\n\nReturn <em>an array </em><code>answer</code><em> of size </em><code>n</code><em> where </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the </em><code>i<sup>th</sup></code><em> column at the top, or <code>-1</code><em> if the ball gets stuck in the box</em>.</em>\n\n",
