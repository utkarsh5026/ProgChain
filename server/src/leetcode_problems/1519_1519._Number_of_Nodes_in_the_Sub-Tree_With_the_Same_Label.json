    "description": "You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of <code>n</code> nodes numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> and exactly <code>n - 1</code> <code>edges</code>. The <strong>root</strong> of the tree is the node <code>0</code>, and each node of the tree has <strong>a label</strong> which is a lower-case character given in the string <code>labels</code> (i.e. The node with the number <code>i</code> has the label <code>labels[i]</code>).\n\nThe <code>edges</code> array is given on the form <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code>, which means there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.\n\nReturn <em>an array of size <code>n</code></em> where <code>ans[i]</code> is the number of nodes in the subtree of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node which have the same label as node <code>i</code>.\n\nA subtree of a tree <code>T</code> is the tree consisting of a node in <code>T</code> and all of its descendant nodes.\n\n",
