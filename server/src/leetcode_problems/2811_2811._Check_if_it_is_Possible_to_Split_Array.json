    "description": "You are given an array <code>nums</code> of length <code>n</code> and an integer <code>m</code>. You need to determine if it is possible to split the array into <code>n</code> arrays of size 1 by performing a series of steps.\n\nAn array is called <strong>good</strong> if:\n\nIn each step, you can select an existing array (which may be the result of previous steps) with a length of <strong>at least two</strong> and split it into <strong>two </strong>arrays, if both resulting arrays are good.\n\nReturn true if you can split the given array into <code>n</code> arrays, otherwise return false.\n\n",
