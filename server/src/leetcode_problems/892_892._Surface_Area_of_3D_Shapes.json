Each value <code>v = grid[i][j]</code> represents a tower of <code>v</code> cubes placed on top of cell <code>(i, j)</code>.\n\nAfter placing these cubes, you have decided to glue any directly adjacent cubes to each other, forming several irregular 3D shapes.\n\nReturn <em>the total surface area of the resulting shapes</em>.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> The bottom face of each shape counts toward its surface area.\n\n",
