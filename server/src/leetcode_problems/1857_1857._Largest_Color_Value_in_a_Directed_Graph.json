    "description": "There is a <strong>directed graph</strong> of <code>n</code> colored nodes and <code>m</code> edges. The nodes are numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.\n\nYou are given a string <code>colors</code> where <code>colors[i]</code> is a lowercase English letter representing the <strong>color</strong> of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node in this graph (<strong>0-indexed</strong>). You are also given a 2D array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[j] = [a<sub>j</sub>, b<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a <strong>directed edge</strong> from node <code>a<sub>j</sub></code> to node <code>b<sub>j</sub></code>.\n\nA valid <strong>path</strong> in the graph is a sequence of nodes <code>x<sub>1</sub> -&gt; x<sub>2</sub> -&gt; x<sub>3</sub> -&gt; ... -&gt; x<sub>k</sub></code> such that there is a directed edge from <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>x<sub>i+1</sub></code> for every <code>1 &lt;= i &lt; k</code>. The <strong>color value</strong> of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the <strong>most frequently</strong> occurring color along that path.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>largest color value</strong> of any valid path in the given graph, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if the graph contains a cycle</em>.\n\n",
