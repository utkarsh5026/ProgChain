    "description": "We have <code>n</code> buildings numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. Each building has a number of employees. It's transfer season, and some employees want to change the building they reside in.\n\nYou are given an array <code>requests</code> where <code>requests[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents an employee's request to transfer from building <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to building <code>to<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\n<strong>All buildings are full</strong>, so a list of requests is achievable only if for each building, the <strong>net change in employee transfers is zero</strong>. This means the number of employees <strong>leaving</strong> is <strong>equal</strong> to the number of employees <strong>moving in</strong>. For example if <code>n = 3</code> and two employees are leaving building <code>0</code>, one is leaving building <code>1</code>, and one is leaving building <code>2</code>, there should be two employees moving to building <code>0</code>, one employee moving to building <code>1</code>, and one employee moving to building <code>2</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the maximum number of achievable requests</em>.\n\n",
