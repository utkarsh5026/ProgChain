    "description": "Given the array <code>nums</code>, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is <strong>strictly greater</strong> than the sum of the non&nbsp;included elements in such subsequence.&nbsp;\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with <strong>minimum size</strong> and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the <strong>maximum total sum</strong> of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.&nbsp;\n\nNote that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>. Also return the answer sorted in <strong>non-increasing</strong> order.\n\n",
