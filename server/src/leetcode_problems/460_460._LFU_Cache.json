The key with the smallest <strong>use counter</strong> is the least frequently used key.\n\nWhen a key is first inserted into the cache, its <strong>use counter</strong> is set to <code>1</code> (due to the <code>put</code> operation). The <strong>use counter</strong> for a key in the cache is incremented either a <code>get</code> or <code>put</code> operation is called on it.\n\nThe functions&nbsp;<code data-stringify-type=\"code\">get</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code data-stringify-type=\"code\">put</code>&nbsp;must each run in <code>O(1)</code> average time complexity.\n\n",
