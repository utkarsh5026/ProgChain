Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: <strong>identical</strong> tasks must be separated by at least <code>n</code> intervals due to cooling time.\n\n\u200bReturn the <em>minimum number of intervals</em> required to complete all tasks.\n\n",
