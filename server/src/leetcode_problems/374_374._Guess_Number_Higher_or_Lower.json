    "description": "We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:\n\nI pick a number from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You have to guess which number I picked.\n\nEvery time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.\n\nYou call a pre-defined API <code>int guess(int num)</code>, which returns three possible results:\n\nReturn <em>the number that I picked</em>.\n\n",
