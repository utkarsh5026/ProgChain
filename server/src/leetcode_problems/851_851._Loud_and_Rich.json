    "description": "There is a group of <code>n</code> people labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.\n\nYou are given an array <code>richer</code> where <code>richer[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> has more money than <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> and an integer array <code>quiet</code> where <code>quiet[i]</code> is the quietness of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person. All the given data in richer are <strong>logically correct</strong> (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where <code>x</code> is richer than <code>y</code> and <code>y</code> is richer than <code>x</code> at the same time).\n\nReturn <em>an integer array </em><code>answer</code><em> where </em><code>answer[x] = y</code><em> if </em><code>y</code><em> is the least quiet person (that is, the person </em><code>y</code><em> with the smallest value of </em><code>quiet[y]</code><em>) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person </em><code>x</code>.\n\n",
