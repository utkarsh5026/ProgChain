For any number <code>x</code>, all positive divisors of <code>x</code> <em>except</em> <code>x</code> are called the <strong>proper divisors</strong> of <code>x</code>.\n\nA number is called <strong>special</strong> if it has exactly 2 <strong>proper divisors</strong>. For example:\n\nReturn the count of numbers in the range <code>[l, r]</code> that are <strong>not</strong> <strong>special</strong>.\n\n",
