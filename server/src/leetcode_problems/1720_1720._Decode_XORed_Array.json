    "description": "There is a <strong>hidden</strong> integer array <code>arr</code> that consists of <code>n</code> non-negative integers.\n\nIt was encoded into another integer array <code>encoded</code> of length <code>n - 1</code>, such that <code>encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]</code>. For example, if <code>arr = [1,0,2,1]</code>, then <code>encoded = [1,2,3]</code>.\n\nYou are given the <code>encoded</code> array. You are also given an integer <code>first</code>, that is the first element of <code>arr</code>, i.e. <code>arr[0]</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the original array</em> <code>arr</code>. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.\n\n",
