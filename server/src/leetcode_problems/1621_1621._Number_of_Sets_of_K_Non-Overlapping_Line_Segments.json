    "description": "Given <code>n</code> points on a 1-D plane, where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> point (from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>) is at <code>x = i</code>, find the number of ways we can draw <strong>exactly</strong> <code>k</code> <strong>non-overlapping</strong> line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have <strong>integral coordinates</strong>. The <code>k</code> line segments <strong>do not</strong> have to cover all <code>n</code> points, and they are <strong>allowed</strong> to share endpoints.\n\nReturn <em>the number of ways we can draw </em><code>k</code><em> non-overlapping line segments</em><em>.</em> Since this number can be huge, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
