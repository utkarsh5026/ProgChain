The integers in the grid represent the following:\n\nIt takes <code>1</code> step to travel between adjacent grid cells.\n\nYou are also given integer arrays <code>pricing</code> and <code>start</code> where <code>pricing = [low, high]</code> and <code>start = [row, col]</code> indicates that you start at the position <code>(row, col)</code> and are interested only in items with a price in the range of <code>[low, high]</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>). You are further given an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nYou are interested in the <strong>positions</strong> of the <code>k</code> <strong>highest-ranked</strong> items whose prices are <strong>within</strong> the given price range. The rank is determined by the <strong>first</strong> of these criteria that is different:\n\nReturn <em>the </em><code>k</code><em> highest-ranked items within the price range <strong>sorted</strong> by their rank (highest to lowest)</em>. If there are fewer than <code>k</code> reachable items within the price range, return <em><strong>all</strong> of them</em>.\n\n",
