    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D array <code>grid</code> of size <code>2 x n</code>, where <code>grid[r][c]</code> represents the number of points at position <code>(r, c)</code> on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.\n\nBoth robots initially start at <code>(0, 0)</code> and want to reach <code>(1, n-1)</code>. Each robot may only move to the <strong>right</strong> (<code>(r, c)</code> to <code>(r, c + 1)</code>) or <strong>down </strong>(<code>(r, c)</code> to <code>(r + 1, c)</code>).\n\nAt the start of the game, the <strong>first</strong> robot moves from <code>(0, 0)</code> to <code>(1, n-1)</code>, collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells <code>(r, c)</code> traversed on the path, <code>grid[r][c]</code> is set to <code>0</code>. Then, the <strong>second</strong> robot moves from <code>(0, 0)</code> to <code>(1, n-1)</code>, collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.\n\nThe <strong>first</strong> robot wants to <strong>minimize</strong> the number of points collected by the <strong>second</strong> robot. In contrast, the <strong>second </strong>robot wants to <strong>maximize</strong> the number of points it collects. If both robots play <strong>optimally</strong>, return <em>the <b>number of points</b> collected by the <strong>second</strong> robot.</em>\n\n",
