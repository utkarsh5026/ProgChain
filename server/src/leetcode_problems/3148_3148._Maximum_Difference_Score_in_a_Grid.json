You can move from a cell in the matrix to <strong>any</strong> other cell that is either to the bottom or to the right (not necessarily adjacent). The score of a move from a cell with the value <code>c1</code> to a cell with the value <code>c2</code> is <code>c2 - c1</code>.\n\nYou can start at <strong>any</strong> cell, and you have to make <strong>at least</strong> one move.\n\nReturn the <strong>maximum</strong> total score you can achieve.\n\n",
