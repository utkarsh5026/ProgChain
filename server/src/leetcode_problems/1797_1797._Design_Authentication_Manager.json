    "description": "There is an authentication system that works with authentication tokens. For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire <code>timeToLive</code> seconds after the <code>currentTime</code>. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be <b>extended</b> to expire <code>timeToLive</code> seconds after the (potentially different) <code>currentTime</code>.\n\nImplement the <code>AuthenticationManager</code> class:\n\nNote that if a token expires at time <code>t</code>, and another action happens on time <code>t</code> (<code>renew</code> or <code>countUnexpiredTokens</code>), the expiration takes place <strong>before</strong> the other actions.\n\n",
