    "description": "You are given an array of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles <code>rects</code> where <code>rects[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that <code>(a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>)</code> is the bottom-left corner point of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> rectangle and <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code> is the top-right corner point of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> rectangle. Design an algorithm to pick a random integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangle.\n\nAny integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles should be equally likely to be returned.\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that an integer point is a point that has integer coordinates.\n\nImplement the <code>Solution</code> class:\n\n",
