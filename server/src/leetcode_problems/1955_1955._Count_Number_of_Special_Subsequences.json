    "description": "A sequence is <strong>special</strong> if it consists of a <strong>positive</strong> number of <code>0</code>s, followed by a <strong>positive</strong> number of <code>1</code>s, then a <strong>positive</strong> number of <code>2</code>s.\n\nGiven an array <code>nums</code> (consisting of <strong>only</strong> integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code>), return<em> the <strong>number of different subsequences</strong> that are special</em>. Since the answer may be very large, <strong>return it modulo </strong><code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Two subsequences are <strong>different</strong> if the <strong>set of indices</strong> chosen are different.\n\n",
