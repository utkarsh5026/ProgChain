    "description": "You are given an array <code>nums</code> consisting of <strong>positive</strong> integers and an integer <code>k</code>.\n\n<strong>Partition</strong> the array into two ordered <strong>groups</strong> such that each element is in exactly <strong>one</strong> group. A partition is called great if the <strong>sum</strong> of elements of each group is greater than or equal to <code>k</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the number of <strong>distinct</strong> great partitions</em>. Since the answer may be too large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nTwo partitions are considered distinct if some element <code>nums[i]</code> is in different groups in the two partitions.\n\n",
