    "description": "You are given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> of the same length and an integer <code>maxCost</code>.\n\nYou want to change <code>s</code> to <code>t</code>. Changing the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> character of <code>s</code> to <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> character of <code>t</code> costs <code>|s[i] - t[i]|</code> (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).\n\nReturn <em>the maximum length of a substring of </em><code>s</code><em> that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of </em><code>t</code><em> with a cost less than or equal to </em><code>maxCost</code>. If there is no substring from <code>s</code> that can be changed to its corresponding substring from <code>t</code>, return <code>0</code>.\n\n",
