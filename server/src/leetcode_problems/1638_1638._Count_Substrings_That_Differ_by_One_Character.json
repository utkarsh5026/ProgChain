    "description": "Given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of <code>s</code> and replace a <strong>single character</strong> by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of <code>t</code>. In other words, find the number of substrings in <code>s</code> that differ from some substring in <code>t</code> by <strong>exactly</strong> one character.\n\nFor example, the underlined substrings in <code>\"<u>compute</u>r\"</code> and <code>\"<u>computa</u>tion\"</code> only differ by the <code>'e'</code>/<code>'a'</code>, so this is a valid way.\n\nReturn <em>the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.</em>\n\nA <strong>substring</strong> is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n",
