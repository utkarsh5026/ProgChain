    "description": "You have <code>n</code> gardens, labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>, and an array <code>paths</code> where <code>paths[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> describes a bidirectional path between garden <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> to garden <code>y<sub>i</sub></code>. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.\n\nAll gardens have <strong>at most 3</strong> paths coming into or leaving it.\n\nYour task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.\n\nReturn <em><strong>any</strong> such a choice as an array </em><code>answer</code><em>, where </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> is the type of flower planted in the </em><code>(i+1)<sup>th</sup></code><em> garden. The flower types are denoted </em><code>1</code><em>, </em><code>2</code><em>, </em><code>3</code><em>, or </em><code>4</code><em>. It is guaranteed an answer exists.</em>\n\n",
