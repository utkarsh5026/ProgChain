    "description": "You are given an integer array <code>nums</code>. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.\n\nPlayer 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of <code>0</code>. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., <code>nums[0]</code> or <code>nums[nums.length - 1]</code>) which reduces the size of the array by <code>1</code>. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.\n\nReturn <code>true</code> if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return <code>true</code>. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.\n\n",
