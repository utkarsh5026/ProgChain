    "description": "You are given an array of variable pairs <code>equations</code> and an array of real numbers <code>values</code>, where <code>equations[i] = [A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub>]</code> and <code>values[i]</code> represent the equation <code>A<sub>i</sub> / B<sub>i</sub> = values[i]</code>. Each <code>A<sub>i</sub></code> or <code>B<sub>i</sub></code> is a string that represents a single variable.\n\nYou are also given some <code>queries</code>, where <code>queries[j] = [C<sub>j</sub>, D<sub>j</sub>]</code> represents the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query where you must find the answer for <code>C<sub>j</sub> / D<sub>j</sub> = ?</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the answers to all queries</em>. If a single answer cannot be determined, return <code>-1.0</code>.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.\n\n<strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.\n\n",
