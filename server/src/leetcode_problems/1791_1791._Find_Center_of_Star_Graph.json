    "description": "There is an undirected <strong>star</strong> graph consisting of <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. A star graph is a graph where there is one <strong>center</strong> node and <strong>exactly</strong> <code>n - 1</code> edges that connect the center node with every other node.\n\nYou are given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> where each <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between the nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. Return the center of the given star graph.\n\n",
