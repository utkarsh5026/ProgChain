There exists a staircase with an infinite number of stairs, with the <strong>lowest</strong> stair numbered 0.\n\nAlice has an integer <code>jump</code>, with an initial value of 0. She starts on stair 1 and wants to reach stair <code>k</code> using <strong>any</strong> number of <strong>operations</strong>. If she is on stair <code>i</code>, in one <strong>operation</strong> she can:\n\nReturn the <em>total</em> number of ways Alice can reach stair <code>k</code>.\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that it is possible that Alice reaches the stair <code>k</code>, and performs some operations to reach the stair <code>k</code> again.\n\n",
