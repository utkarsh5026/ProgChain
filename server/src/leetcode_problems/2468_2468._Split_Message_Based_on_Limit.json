    "description": "You are given a string, <code>message</code>, and a positive integer, <code>limit</code>.\n\nYou must <strong>split</strong> <code>message</code> into one or more <strong>parts</strong> based on <code>limit</code>. Each resulting part should have the suffix <code>\"&lt;a/b&gt;\"</code>, where <code>\"b\"</code> is to be <strong>replaced</strong> with the total number of parts and <code>\"a\"</code> is to be <strong>replaced</strong> with the index of the part, starting from <code>1</code> and going up to <code>b</code>. Additionally, the length of each resulting part (including its suffix) should be <strong>equal</strong> to <code>limit</code>, except for the last part whose length can be <strong>at most</strong> <code>limit</code>.\n\nThe resulting parts should be formed such that when their suffixes are removed and they are all concatenated <strong>in order</strong>, they should be equal to <code>message</code>. Also, the result should contain as few parts as possible.\n\nReturn<em> the parts </em><code>message</code><em> would be split into as an array of strings</em>. If it is impossible to split <code>message</code> as required, return<em> an empty array</em>.\n\n",
