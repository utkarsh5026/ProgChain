    "description": "Given the <code>root</code> node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n<strong>Node Representation</strong>: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.\n\n<strong>Parentheses for Children</strong>: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:\n\n<strong>Omitting Empty Parentheses</strong>: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., <code>()</code>) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.\n\nIn summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.\n\n",
