During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.\n\nEvery house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.&nbsp;\n\nGiven the positions of <code>houses</code> and <code>heaters</code> on a horizontal line, return <em>the minimum radius standard of heaters&nbsp;so that those heaters could cover all houses.</em>\n\n<strong>Notice</strong> that&nbsp;all the <code>heaters</code> follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.\n\n",
