    "description": "There is a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of <code>n</code> nodes numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> and exactly <code>n - 1</code> edges.\n\nYou are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>vals</code> of length <code>n</code> where <code>vals[i]</code> denotes the value of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node. You are also given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists an <strong>undirected</strong> edge connecting nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nA <strong>good path</strong> is a simple path that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nReturn <em>the number of distinct good paths</em>.\n\nNote that a path and its reverse are counted as the <strong>same</strong> path. For example, <code>0 -&gt; 1</code> is considered to be the same as <code>1 -&gt; 0</code>. A single node is also considered as a valid path.\n\n",
