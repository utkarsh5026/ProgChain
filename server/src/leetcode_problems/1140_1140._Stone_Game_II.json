    "description": "Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles <strong>arranged in a row</strong>, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones <code>piles[i]</code>. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.\n\nAlice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.\n\nOn each player's turn, that player can take <strong>all the stones</strong> in the <strong>first</strong> <code>X</code> remaining piles, where <code>1 &lt;= X &lt;= 2M</code>. Then, we set <code>M = max(M, X)</code>. Initially, M = 1.\n\nThe game continues until all the stones have been taken.\n\nAssuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.\n\n",
