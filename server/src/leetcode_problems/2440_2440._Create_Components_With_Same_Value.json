    "description": "There is an undirected tree with <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.\n\nYou are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code><font face=\"monospace\">nums</font></code> of length <code>n</code> where <code>nums[i]</code> represents the value of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node. You are also given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.\n\nYou are allowed to <strong>delete</strong> some edges, splitting the tree into multiple connected components. Let the <strong>value</strong> of a component be the sum of <strong>all</strong> <code>nums[i]</code> for which node <code>i</code> is in the component.\n\nReturn<em> the <strong>maximum</strong> number of edges you can delete, such that every connected component in the tree has the same value.</em>\n\n",
