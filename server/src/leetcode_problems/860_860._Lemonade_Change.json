    "description": "At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs <code>$5</code>. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a <code>$5</code>, <code>$10</code>, or <code>$20</code> bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays <code>$5</code>.\n\nNote that you do not have any change in hand at first.\n\nGiven an integer array <code>bills</code> where <code>bills[i]</code> is the bill the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> customer pays, return <code>true</code> <em>if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or</em> <code>false</code> <em>otherwise</em>.\n\n",
