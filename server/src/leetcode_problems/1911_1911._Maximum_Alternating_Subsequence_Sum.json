    "description": "The <strong>alternating sum</strong> of a <strong>0-indexed</strong> array is defined as the <strong>sum</strong> of the elements at <strong>even</strong> indices <strong>minus</strong> the <strong>sum</strong> of the elements at <strong>odd</strong> indices.\n\nGiven an array <code>nums</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum alternating sum</strong> of any subsequence of </em><code>nums</code><em> (after <strong>reindexing</strong> the elements of the subsequence)</em>.\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, <code>[2,7,4]</code> is a subsequence of <code>[4,<u>2</u>,3,<u>7</u>,2,1,<u>4</u>]</code> (the underlined elements), while <code>[2,4,2]</code> is not.\n\n",
