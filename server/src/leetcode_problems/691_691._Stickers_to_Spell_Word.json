    "description": "We are given <code>n</code> different types of <code>stickers</code>. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.\n\nYou would like to spell out the given string <code>target</code> by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them. You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out </em><code>target</code>. If the task is impossible, return <code>-1</code>.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the <code>1000</code> most common US English words, and <code>target</code> was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.\n\n",
