    "description": "You are given an array of integers <code>nums</code> represents the numbers written on a chalkboard.\n\nAlice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first. If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become <code>0</code>, then that player loses. The bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is <code>0</code>.\n\nAlso, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to <code>0</code>, then that player wins.\n\nReturn <code>true</code> <em>if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally</em>.\n\n",
