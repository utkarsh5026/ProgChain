    "description": "You are given the two integers, <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> and two integer arrays, <code>hBars</code> and <code>vBars</code>. The grid has <code>n + 2</code> horizontal and <code>m + 2</code> vertical bars, creating 1 x 1 unit cells. The bars are indexed starting from <code>1</code>.\n\nYou can <strong>remove</strong> some of the bars in <code>hBars</code> from horizontal bars and some of the bars in <code>vBars</code> from vertical bars. Note that other bars are fixed and cannot be removed.\n\nReturn an integer denoting the <strong>maximum area</strong> of a <em>square-shaped</em> hole in the grid, after removing some bars (possibly none).\n\n",
