    "description": "There is a supermarket that is frequented by many customers. The products sold at the supermarket are represented as two parallel integer arrays <code>products</code> and <code>prices</code>, where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> product has an ID of <code>products[i]</code> and a price of <code>prices[i]</code>.\n\nWhen a customer is paying, their bill is represented as two parallel integer arrays <code>product</code> and <code>amount</code>, where the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> product they purchased has an ID of <code>product[j]</code>, and <code>amount[j]</code> is how much of the product they bought. Their subtotal is calculated as the sum of each <code>amount[j] * (price of the j<sup>th</sup> product)</code>.\n\nThe supermarket decided to have a sale. Every <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> customer paying for their groceries will be given a <strong>percentage discount</strong>. The discount amount is given by <code>discount</code>, where they will be given <code>discount</code> percent off their subtotal. More formally, if their subtotal is <code>bill</code>, then they would actually pay <code>bill * ((100 - discount) / 100)</code>.\n\nImplement the <code>Cashier</code> class:\n\n",
