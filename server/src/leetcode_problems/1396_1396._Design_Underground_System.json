They are using this data to calculate the average time it takes to travel from one station to another.\n\nImplement the <code>UndergroundSystem</code> class:\n\nYou may assume all calls to the <code>checkIn</code> and <code>checkOut</code> methods are consistent. If a customer checks in at time <code>t<sub>1</sub></code> then checks out at time <code>t<sub>2</sub></code>, then <code>t<sub>1</sub> &lt; t<sub>2</sub></code>. All events happen in chronological order.\n\n",
