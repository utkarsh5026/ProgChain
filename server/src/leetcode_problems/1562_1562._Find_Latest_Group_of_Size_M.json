    "description": "Given an array <code>arr</code> that represents a permutation of numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.\n\nYou have a binary string of size <code>n</code> that initially has all its bits set to zero. At each step <code>i</code> (assuming both the binary string and <code>arr</code> are 1-indexed) from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>, the bit at position <code>arr[i]</code> is set to <code>1</code>.\n\nYou are also given an integer <code>m</code>. Find the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length <code>m</code>. A group of ones is a contiguous substring of <code>1</code>'s such that it cannot be extended in either direction.\n\nReturn <em>the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length <strong>exactly</strong></em> <code>m</code>. <em>If no such group exists, return</em> <code>-1</code>.\n\n",
