    "description": "There are <code>buckets</code> buckets of liquid, where <strong>exactly one</strong> of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have <code>minutesToTest</code> minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.\n\nYou can feed the pigs according to these steps:\n\nGiven <code>buckets</code>, <code>minutesToDie</code>, and <code>minutesToTest</code>, return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time</em>.\n\n",
