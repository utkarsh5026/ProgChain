    "description": "You are given a string <code node=\"[object Object]\">s</code> consisting of <strong>lowercase English letters</strong>, and you are allowed to perform operations on it. In one operation, you can <strong>replace</strong> a character in <code node=\"[object Object]\">s</code> with another lowercase English letter.\n\nYour task is to make <code node=\"[object Object]\">s</code> a <strong>palindrome</strong> with the <strong>minimum</strong> <strong>number</strong> <strong>of operations</strong> possible. If there are <strong>multiple palindromes</strong> that can be <meta charset=\"utf-8\">made using the <strong>minimum</strong> number of operations, <meta charset=\"utf-8\">make the <strong>lexicographically smallest</strong> one.\n\nA string <code>a</code> is lexicographically smaller than a string <code>b</code> (of the same length) if in the first position where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> differ, string <code>a</code> has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in <code>b</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the resulting palindrome string.</em>\n\n",
