    "description": "There is a <strong>bi-directional</strong> graph with <code>n</code> vertices, where each vertex is labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array <code>edges</code>, where each <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and vertex <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. Every vertex pair is connected by <strong>at most one</strong> edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.\n\nYou want to determine if there is a <strong>valid path</strong> that exists from vertex <code>source</code> to vertex <code>destination</code>.\n\nGiven <code>edges</code> and the integers <code>n</code>, <code>source</code>, and <code>destination</code>, return <code>true</code><em> if there is a <strong>valid path</strong> from </em><code>source</code><em> to </em><code>destination</code><em>, or </em><code>false</code><em> otherwise</em><em>.</em>\n\n",
