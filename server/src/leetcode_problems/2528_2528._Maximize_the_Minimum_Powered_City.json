    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>stations</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>stations[i]</code> represents the number of power stations in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> city.\n\nEach power station can provide power to every city in a fixed <strong>range</strong>. In other words, if the range is denoted by <code>r</code>, then a power station at city <code>i</code> can provide power to all cities <code>j</code> such that <code>|i - j| &lt;= r</code> and <code>0 &lt;= i, j &lt;= n - 1</code>.\n\nThe <strong>power</strong> of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.\n\nThe government has sanctioned building <code>k</code> more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.\n\nGiven the two integers <code>r</code> and <code>k</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum possible minimum power</strong> of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.</em>\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that you can build the <code>k</code> power stations in multiple cities.\n\n",
