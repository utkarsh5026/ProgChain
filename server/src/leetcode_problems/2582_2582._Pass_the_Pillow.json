Every second, the person holding the pillow passes it to the next person standing in the line. Once the pillow reaches the end of the line, the direction changes, and people continue passing the pillow in the opposite direction.\n\nGiven the two positive integers <code>n</code> and <code>time</code>, return <em>the index of the person holding the pillow after </em><code>time</code><em> seconds</em>.\n\n",
