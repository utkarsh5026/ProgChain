    "description": "A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from <code>'A'</code>, <code>'C'</code>, <code>'G'</code>, and <code>'T'</code>.\n\nSuppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string <code>startGene</code> to a gene string <code>endGene</code> where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.\n\nThere is also a gene bank <code>bank</code> that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in <code>bank</code> to make it a valid gene string.\n\nGiven the two gene strings <code>startGene</code> and <code>endGene</code> and the gene bank <code>bank</code>, return <em>the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from </em><code>startGene</code><em> to </em><code>endGene</code>. If there is no such a mutation, return <code>-1</code>.\n\nNote that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.\n\n",
