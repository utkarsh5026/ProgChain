    "description": "You are given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>.\n\nYou are allowed to remove any number of characters from the string <code>t</code>.\n\nThe score of the string is <code>0</code> if no characters are removed from the string <code>t</code>, otherwise:\n\nThen the score of the string is <code>right - left + 1</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum possible score to make </em><code>t</code><em>&nbsp;a subsequence of </em><code>s</code><em>.</em>\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., <code>\"ace\"</code> is a subsequence of <code>\"<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>\"</code> while <code>\"aec\"</code> is not).\n\n",
