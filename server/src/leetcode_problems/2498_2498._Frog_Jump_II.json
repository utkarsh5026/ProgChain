    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>stones</code> sorted in <strong>strictly increasing order</strong> representing the positions of stones in a river.\n\nA frog, initially on the first stone, wants to travel to the last stone and then return to the first stone. However, it can jump to any stone <strong>at most once</strong>.\n\nThe <strong>length</strong> of a jump is the absolute difference between the position of the stone the frog is currently on and the position of the stone to which the frog jumps.\n\nThe <strong>cost</strong> of a path is the <strong>maximum length of a jump</strong> among all jumps in the path.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> cost of a path for the frog</em>.\n\n",
