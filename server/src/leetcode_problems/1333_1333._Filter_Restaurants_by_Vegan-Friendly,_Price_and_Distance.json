    "description": "Given the array <code>restaurants</code> where &nbsp;<code>restaurants[i] = [id<sub>i</sub>, rating<sub>i</sub>, veganFriendly<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>, distance<sub>i</sub>]</code>. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.\n\nThe <code>veganFriendly</code> filter will be either <em>true</em> (meaning you should only include restaurants with <code>veganFriendly<sub>i</sub></code> set to true)&nbsp;or <em>false</em>&nbsp;(meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters&nbsp;<code>maxPrice</code> and <code>maxDistance</code>&nbsp;which&nbsp;are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.\n\nReturn the array of restaurant <em><strong>IDs</strong></em> after filtering, ordered by <strong>rating</strong> from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by <em><strong>id</strong></em> from highest to lowest. For simplicity <code>veganFriendly<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>veganFriendly</code> take value <em>1</em> when it is <em>true</em>, and <em>0</em> when it is <em>false</em>.\n\n",
