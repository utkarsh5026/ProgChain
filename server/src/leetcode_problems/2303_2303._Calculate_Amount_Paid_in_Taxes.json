    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>brackets</code> where <code>brackets[i] = [upper<sub>i</sub>, percent<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> tax bracket has an upper bound of <code>upper<sub>i</sub></code> and is taxed at a rate of <code>percent<sub>i</sub></code>. The brackets are <strong>sorted</strong> by upper bound (i.e. <code>upper<sub>i-1</sub> &lt; upper<sub>i</sub></code> for <code>0 &lt; i &lt; brackets.length</code>).\n\nTax is calculated as follows:\n\nYou are given an integer <code>income</code> representing the amount of money you earned.
