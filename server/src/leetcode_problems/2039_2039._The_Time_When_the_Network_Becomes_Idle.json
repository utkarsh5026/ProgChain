    "description": "There is a network of <code>n</code> servers, labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You are given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates there is a message channel between servers <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>, and they can pass <strong>any</strong> number of messages to <strong>each other</strong> directly in <strong>one</strong> second. You are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>patience</code> of length <code>n</code>.\n\nAll servers are <strong>connected</strong>, i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels.\n\nThe server labeled <code>0</code> is the <strong>master</strong> server. The rest are <strong>data</strong> servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers <strong>optimally</strong>, so every message takes the <strong>least amount of time</strong> to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages <strong>instantly</strong> and send a reply to the originating server via the <strong>reversed path</strong> the message had gone through.\n\nAt the beginning of second <code>0</code>, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second <code>1</code>, at the <strong>beginning</strong> of <strong>every</strong> second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:\n\nThe network becomes <strong>idle</strong> when there are <strong>no</strong> messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>earliest second</strong> starting from which the network becomes <strong>idle</strong></em>.\n\n",
