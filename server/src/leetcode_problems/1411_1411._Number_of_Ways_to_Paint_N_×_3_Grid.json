    "description": "You have a <code>grid</code> of size <code>n x 3</code> and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: <strong>Red</strong>, <strong>Yellow,</strong> or <strong>Green</strong> while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).\n\nGiven <code>n</code> the number of rows of the grid, return <em>the number of ways</em> you can paint this <code>grid</code>. As the answer may grow large, the answer <strong>must be</strong> computed modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
