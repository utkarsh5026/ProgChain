    "description": "You are given a 2D integer array <code>grid</code> of size <code>m x n</code>, where each cell contains a positive integer.\n\nA <strong>cornered path</strong> is defined as a set of adjacent cells with <strong>at most</strong> one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either <strong>horizontally</strong> or <strong>vertically</strong> up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the <strong>alternate</strong> direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.\n\nThe <strong>product</strong> of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of <strong>trailing zeros</strong> in the product of a cornered path found in </em><code>grid</code>.\n\nNote:\n\n",
