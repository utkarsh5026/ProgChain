    "description": "Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules:\n\nFor example, if Alice and Bob both shot <code>2</code> arrows on the section with score <code>11</code>, then Alice takes <code>11</code> points. On the other hand, if Alice shot <code>0</code> arrows on the section with score <code>11</code> and Bob shot <code>2</code> arrows on that same section, then Bob takes <code>11</code> points.\n\nYou are given the integer <code>numArrows</code> and an integer array <code>aliceArrows</code> of size <code>12</code>, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from <code>0</code> to <code>11</code>. Now, Bob wants to <strong>maximize</strong> the total number of points he can obtain.\n\nReturn <em>the array </em><code>bobArrows</code><em> which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on <strong>each</strong> scoring section from </em><code>0</code><em> to </em><code>11</code>. The sum of the values in <code>bobArrows</code> should equal <code>numArrows</code>.\n\nIf there are multiple ways for Bob to earn the maximum total points, return <strong>any</strong> one of them.\n\n",
