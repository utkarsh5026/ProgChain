    "description": "Given a weighted undirected connected graph with <code>n</code>&nbsp;vertices numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>,&nbsp;and an array <code>edges</code>&nbsp;where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes&nbsp;<code>a<sub>i</sub></code>&nbsp;and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles&nbsp;and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n\nFind <em>all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST)</em>. An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a&nbsp;<em>critical edge</em>. On&nbsp;the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.\n\nNote that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.\n\n",
