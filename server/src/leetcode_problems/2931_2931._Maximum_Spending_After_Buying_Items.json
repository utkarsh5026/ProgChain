    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m * n</code> integer matrix <code>values</code>, representing the values of <code>m * n</code> different items in <code>m</code> different shops. Each shop has <code>n</code> items where the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> item in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> shop has a value of <code>values[i][j]</code>. Additionally, the items in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> shop are sorted in non-increasing order of value. That is, <code>values[i][j] &gt;= values[i][j + 1]</code> for all <code>0 &lt;= j &lt; n - 1</code>.\n\nOn each day, you would like to buy a single item from one of the shops. Specifically, On the <code>d<sup>th</sup></code> day you can:\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that all items are pairwise different. For example, if you have bought item <code>0</code> from shop <code>1</code>, you can still buy item <code>0</code> from any other shop.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum amount of money that can be spent</strong> on buying all </em> <code>m * n</code> <em>products</em>.\n\n",
