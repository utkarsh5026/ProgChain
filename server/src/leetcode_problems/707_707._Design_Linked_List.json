You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.<br>\nA node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: <code>val</code> and <code>next</code>. <code>val</code> is the value of the current node, and <code>next</code> is a pointer/reference to the next node.<br>\nIf you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute <code>prev</code> to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are <strong>0-indexed</strong>.\n\nImplement the <code>MyLinkedList</code> class:\n\n",
