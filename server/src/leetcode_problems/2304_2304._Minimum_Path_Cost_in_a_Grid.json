    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m x n</code> integer matrix <code>grid</code> consisting of <strong>distinct</strong> integers from <code>0</code> to <code>m * n - 1</code>. You can move in this matrix from a cell to any other cell in the <strong>next</strong> row. That is, if you are in cell <code>(x, y)</code> such that <code>x &lt; m - 1</code>, you can move to any of the cells <code>(x + 1, 0)</code>, <code>(x + 1, 1)</code>, ..., <code>(x + 1, n - 1)</code>. <strong>Note</strong> that it is not possible to move from cells in the last row.\n\nEach possible move has a cost given by a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D array <code>moveCost</code> of size <code>(m * n) x n</code>, where <code>moveCost[i][j]</code> is the cost of moving from a cell with value <code>i</code> to a cell in column <code>j</code> of the next row. The cost of moving from cells in the last row of <code>grid</code> can be ignored.\n\nThe cost of a path in <code>grid</code> is the <strong>sum</strong> of all values of cells visited plus the <strong>sum</strong> of costs of all the moves made. Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> cost of a path that starts from any cell in the <strong>first</strong> row and ends at any cell in the <strong>last</strong> row.</em>\n\n",
