    "description": "Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with <strong>Alice starting first</strong>.\n\nThere are <code>n</code> stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is <strong>more than one</strong>, they will do the following:\n\nThe game stops when <strong>only</strong> <strong>one</strong> stone is left in the row.\n\nThe <strong>score difference</strong> between Alice and Bob is <code>(Alice's score - Bob's score)</code>. Alice's goal is to <strong>maximize</strong> the score difference, and Bob's goal is the <strong>minimize</strong> the score difference.\n\nGiven an integer array <code>stones</code> of length <code>n</code> where <code>stones[i]</code> represents the value of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> stone <strong>from the left</strong>, return <em>the <strong>score difference</strong> between Alice and Bob if they both play <strong>optimally</strong>.</em>\n\n",
