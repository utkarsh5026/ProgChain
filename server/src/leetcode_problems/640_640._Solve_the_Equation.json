    "description": "Solve a given equation and return the value of <code>'x'</code> in the form of a string <code>\"x=#value\"</code>. The equation contains only <code>'+'</code>, <code>'-'</code> operation, the variable <code>'x'</code> and its coefficient. You should return <code>\"No solution\"</code> if there is no solution for the equation, or <code>\"Infinite solutions\"</code> if there are infinite solutions for the equation.\n\nIf there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of <code>'x'</code> is an integer.\n\n",
