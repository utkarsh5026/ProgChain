There are <code>n</code> coins in total throughout the whole tree.\n\nIn one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of moves required to make every node have <strong>exactly</strong> one coin</em>.\n\n",
