    "description": "There are <code>k</code> workers who want to move <code>n</code> boxes from the right (old) warehouse to the left (new) warehouse. You are given the two integers <code>n</code> and <code>k</code>, and a 2D integer array <code>time</code> of size <code>k x 4</code> where <code>time[i] = [right<sub>i</sub>, pick<sub>i</sub>, left<sub>i</sub>, put<sub>i</sub>]</code>.\n\nThe warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. Initially, all <code>k</code> workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> worker can do the following:\n\nThe <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> worker is <strong>less efficient</strong> than the j<code><sup>th</sup></code> worker if either condition is met:\n\nThe following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge:\n\nReturn the <strong>elapsed minutes</strong> at which the last box reaches the <strong>left side of the bridge</strong>.\n\n",
