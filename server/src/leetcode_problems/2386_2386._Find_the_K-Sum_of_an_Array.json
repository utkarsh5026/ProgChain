    "description": "You are given an integer array <code>nums</code> and a <strong>positive</strong> integer <code>k</code>. You can choose any <strong>subsequence</strong> of the array and sum all of its elements together.\n\nWe define the <strong>K-Sum</strong> of the array as the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> <strong>largest</strong> subsequence sum that can be obtained (<strong>not</strong> necessarily distinct).\n\nReturn <em>the K-Sum of the array</em>.\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that the empty subsequence is considered to have a sum of <code>0</code>.\n\n",
