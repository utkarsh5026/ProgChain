That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is <code>sum</code>, then you want to <strong>minimize the absolute difference</strong> <code>abs(sum - goal)</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> possible value of</em> <code>abs(sum - goal)</code>.\n\nNote that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements <strong>(possibly all or none)</strong> of the original array.\n\n",
