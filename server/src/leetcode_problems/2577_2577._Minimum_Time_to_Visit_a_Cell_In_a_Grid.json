    "description": "You are given a <code>m x n</code> matrix <code>grid</code> consisting of <b>non-negative</b> integers where <code>grid[row][col]</code> represents the <strong>minimum</strong> time required to be able to visit the cell <code>(row, col)</code>, which means you can visit the cell <code>(row, col)</code> only when the time you visit it is greater than or equal to <code>grid[row][col]</code>.\n\nYou are standing in the <strong>top-left</strong> cell of the matrix in the <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> second, and you must move to <strong>any</strong> adjacent cell in the four directions: up, down, left, and right. Each move you make takes 1 second.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> time required in which you can visit the bottom-right cell of the matrix</em>. If you cannot visit the bottom-right cell, then return <code>-1</code>.\n\n",
