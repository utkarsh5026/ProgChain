    "description": "You are given a 2D integer array <code>points</code>, where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code>. You are also given an integer <code>w</code>. Your task is to <strong>cover</strong> <strong>all</strong> the given points with rectangles.\n\nEach rectangle has its lower end at some point <code>(x<sub>1</sub>, 0)</code> and its upper end at some point <code>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</code>, where <code>x<sub>1</sub> &lt;= x<sub>2</sub></code>, <code>y<sub>2</sub> &gt;= 0</code>, and the condition <code>x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> &lt;= w</code> <strong>must</strong> be satisfied for each rectangle.\n\nA point is considered covered by a rectangle if it lies within or on the boundary of the rectangle.\n\nReturn an integer denoting the <strong>minimum</strong> number of rectangles needed so that each point is covered by <strong>at least one</strong> rectangle<em>.</em>\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> A point may be covered by more than one rectangle.\n\n",
