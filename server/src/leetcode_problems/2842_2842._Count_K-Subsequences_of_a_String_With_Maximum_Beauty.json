    "description": "You are given a string <code>s</code> and an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nA <strong>k-subsequence</strong> is a <strong>subsequence</strong> of <code>s</code>, having length <code>k</code>, and all its characters are <strong>unique</strong>, <strong>i.e</strong>., every character occurs once.\n\nLet <code>f(c)</code> denote the number of times the character <code>c</code> occurs in <code>s</code>.\n\nThe <strong>beauty</strong> of a <strong>k-subsequence</strong> is the <strong>sum</strong> of <code>f(c)</code> for every character <code>c</code> in the k-subsequence.\n\nFor example, consider <code>s = \"abbbdd\"</code> and <code>k = 2</code>:\n\nReturn <em>an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences </em><em>whose <strong>beauty</strong> is the <strong>maximum</strong> among all <strong>k-subsequences</strong></em>. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nA subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.\n\n<strong>Notes</strong>\n\n",
