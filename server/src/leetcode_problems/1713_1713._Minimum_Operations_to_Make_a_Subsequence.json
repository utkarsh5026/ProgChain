    "description": "You are given an array <code>target</code> that consists of <strong>distinct</strong> integers and another integer array <code>arr</code> that <strong>can</strong> have duplicates.\n\nIn one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in <code>arr</code>. For example, if <code>arr = [1,4,1,2]</code>, you can add <code>3</code> in the middle and make it <code>[1,4,<u>3</u>,1,2]</code>. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning or end of the array.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of operations needed to make </em><code>target</code><em> a <strong>subsequence</strong> of </em><code>arr</code><em>.</em>\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, <code>[2,7,4]</code> is a subsequence of <code>[4,<u>2</u>,3,<u>7</u>,2,1,<u>4</u>]</code> (the underlined elements), while <code>[2,4,2]</code> is not.\n\n",
