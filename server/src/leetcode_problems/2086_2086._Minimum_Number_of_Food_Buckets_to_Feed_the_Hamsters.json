    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>hamsters</code> where <code>hamsters[i]</code> is either:\n\nYou will add some number of food buckets at the empty indices in order to feed the hamsters. A hamster can be fed if there is at least one food bucket to its left or to its right. More formally, a hamster at index <code>i</code> can be fed if you place a food bucket at index <code>i - 1</code> <strong>and/or</strong> at index <code>i + 1</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum number of food buckets you should <strong>place at empty indices</strong> to feed all the hamsters or </em><code>-1</code><em> if it is impossible to feed all of them</em>.\n\n",
