    "description": "You are given four integers, <code>m</code>, <code>n</code>, <code>introvertsCount</code>, and <code>extrovertsCount</code>. You have an <code>m x n</code> grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are <code>introvertsCount</code> introverts and <code>extrovertsCount</code> extroverts.\n\nYou should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you <strong>do not</strong> have to have all the people living in the grid.\n\nThe <strong>happiness</strong> of each person is calculated as follows:\n\nNeighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.\n\nThe <strong>grid happiness</strong> is the <strong>sum</strong> of each person's happiness. Return<em> the <strong>maximum possible grid happiness</strong>.</em>\n\n",
