    "description": "You are given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree with <code>n</code> nodes, where each node is uniquely assigned a value from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You are also given a sequence of <code>n</code> values <code>voyage</code>, which is the <strong>desired</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>pre-order traversal</strong></a> of the binary tree.\n\nAny node in the binary tree can be <strong>flipped</strong> by swapping its left and right subtrees. For example, flipping node 1 will have the following effect:\n\nFlip the <strong>smallest</strong> number of nodes so that the <strong>pre-order traversal</strong> of the tree <strong>matches</strong> <code>voyage</code>.\n\nReturn <em>a list of the values of all <strong>flipped</strong> nodes. You may return the answer in <strong>any order</strong>. If it is <strong>impossible</strong> to flip the nodes in the tree to make the pre-order traversal match </em><code>voyage</code><em>, return the list </em><code>[-1]</code>.\n\n",
