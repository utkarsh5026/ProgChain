    "description": "There is a <strong>bi-directional </strong>graph with <code>n</code> vertices, where each vertex is labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. The edges in the graph are represented by a given 2D integer array <code>edges</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes an edge between vertex <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and vertex <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.\n\nReturn <em>the length of the <strong>shortest </strong>cycle in the graph</em>. If no cycle exists, return <code>-1</code>.\n\nA cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is used only once.\n\n",
