    "description": "We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the <strong>first</strong> row has <code>1</code> glass, the <strong>second</strong> row has <code>2</code> glasses, and so on until the 100<sup>th</sup> row.&nbsp; Each glass holds one cup&nbsp;of champagne.\n\nThen, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.&nbsp; When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.&nbsp; When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.&nbsp; (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)\n\nFor example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.&nbsp; After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.&nbsp; After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.&nbsp; After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/03/09/tower.png\" style=\"height: 241px; width: 350px;\">\n\nNow after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> glass in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> row is (both <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are 0-indexed.)\n\n",
