    "description": "Given an undirected tree consisting of <code>n</code> vertices numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. <em>Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at <strong>vertex 0</strong> and coming back to this vertex.</em>\n\nThe edges of the undirected tree are given in the array <code>edges</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that exists an edge connecting the vertices <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. Additionally, there is a boolean array <code>hasApple</code>, where <code>hasApple[i] = true</code> means that vertex <code>i</code> has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.\n\n",
