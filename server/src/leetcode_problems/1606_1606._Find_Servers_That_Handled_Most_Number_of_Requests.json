    "description": "You have <code>k</code> servers numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>k-1</code> that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but <strong>cannot handle more than one request at a time</strong>. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:\n\nYou are given a <strong>strictly increasing</strong> array <code>arrival</code> of positive integers, where <code>arrival[i]</code> represents the arrival time of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> request, and another array <code>load</code>, where <code>load[i]</code> represents the load of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the <strong>busiest server(s)</strong>. A server is considered <strong>busiest</strong> if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.\n\nReturn <em>a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the <strong>busiest server(s)</strong></em>. You may return the IDs in any order.\n\n",
