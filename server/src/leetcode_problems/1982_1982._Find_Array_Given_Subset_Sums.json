    "description": "You are given an integer <code>n</code> representing the length of an unknown array that you are trying to recover. You are also given an array <code>sums</code> containing the values of all <code>2<sup>n</sup></code> <strong>subset sums</strong> of the unknown array (in no particular order).\n\nReturn <em>the array </em><code>ans</code><em> of length </em><code>n</code><em> representing the unknown array. If <strong>multiple</strong> answers exist, return <strong>any</strong> of them</em>.\n\nAn array <code>sub</code> is a <strong>subset</strong> of an array <code>arr</code> if <code>sub</code> can be obtained from <code>arr</code> by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of <code>arr</code>. The sum of the elements in <code>sub</code> is one possible <strong>subset sum</strong> of <code>arr</code>. The sum of an empty array is considered to be <code>0</code>.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> Test cases are generated such that there will <strong>always</strong> be at least one correct answer.\n\n",
