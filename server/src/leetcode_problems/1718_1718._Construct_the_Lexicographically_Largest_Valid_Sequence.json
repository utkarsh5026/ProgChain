    "description": "Given an integer <code>n</code>, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:\n\nThe <strong>distance</strong> between two numbers on the sequence, <code>a[i]</code> and <code>a[j]</code>, is the absolute difference of their indices, <code>|j - i|</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>lexicographically largest</strong> sequence</em><em>. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution. </em>\n\nA sequence <code>a</code> is lexicographically larger than a sequence <code>b</code> (of the same length) if in the first position where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> differ, sequence <code>a</code> has a number greater than the corresponding number in <code>b</code>. For example, <code>[0,1,9,0]</code> is lexicographically larger than <code>[0,1,5,6]</code> because the first position they differ is at the third number, and <code>9</code> is greater than <code>5</code>.\n\n",
