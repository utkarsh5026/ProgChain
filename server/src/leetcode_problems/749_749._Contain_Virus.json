    "description": "A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.\n\nThe world is modeled as an <code>m x n</code> binary grid <code>isInfected</code>, where <code>isInfected[i][j] == 0</code> represents uninfected cells, and <code>isInfected[i][j] == 1</code> represents cells contaminated with the virus. A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two <strong>4-directionally</strong> adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.\n\nEvery night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall. Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region (i.e., the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night). There <strong>will never be a tie</strong>.\n\nReturn <em>the number of walls used to quarantine all the infected regions</em>. If the world will become fully infected, return the number of walls used.\n\n",
