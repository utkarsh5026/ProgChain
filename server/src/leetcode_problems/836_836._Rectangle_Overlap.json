    "description": "An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list <code>[x1, y1, x2, y2]</code>, where <code>(x1, y1)</code> is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and <code>(x2, y2)</code> is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.\n\nTwo rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is <strong>positive</strong>. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.\n\nGiven two axis-aligned rectangles <code>rec1</code> and <code>rec2</code>, return <code>true</code><em> if they overlap, otherwise return </em><code>false</code>.\n\n",
