    "description": "You are currently designing a dynamic array. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>nums</code>, where <code>nums[i]</code> is the number of elements that will be in the array at time <code>i</code>. In addition, you are given an integer <code>k</code>, the <strong>maximum</strong> number of times you can <strong>resize</strong> the array (to<strong> any</strong> size).\n\nThe size of the array at time <code>t</code>, <code>size<sub>t</sub></code>, must be at least <code>nums[t]</code> because there needs to be enough space in the array to hold all the elements. The <strong>space wasted</strong> at&nbsp;time <code>t</code> is defined as <code>size<sub>t</sub> - nums[t]</code>, and the <strong>total</strong> space wasted is the <strong>sum</strong> of the space wasted across every time <code>t</code> where <code>0 &lt;= t &lt; nums.length</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> <strong>total space wasted</strong> if you can resize the array at most</em> <code>k</code> <em>times</em>.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> The array can have <strong>any size</strong> at the start and does<strong> not </strong>count towards the number of resizing operations.\n\n",
