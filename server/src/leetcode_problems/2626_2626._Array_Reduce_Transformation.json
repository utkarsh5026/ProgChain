    "description": "Given an integer array <code>nums</code>, a reducer function <code>fn</code>, and an initial value <code>init</code>, return the final result obtained by executing the <code>fn</code> function on each element of the array, sequentially, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element.\n\nThis result is achieved through the following operations: <code>val = fn(init, nums[0]), val = fn(val, nums[1]), val = fn(val, nums[2]), ...</code> until every element in the array has been processed. The ultimate value of <code>val</code> is then returned.\n\nIf the length of the array is 0, the function should return <code>init</code>.\n\nPlease solve it without using the built-in <code>Array.reduce</code> method.\n\n",
