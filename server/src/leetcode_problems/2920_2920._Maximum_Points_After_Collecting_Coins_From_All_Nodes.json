    "description": "There exists an undirected tree rooted at node <code>0</code> with <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You are given a 2D <strong>integer</strong> array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. You are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> array <code>coins</code> of size <code>n</code> where <code>coins[i]</code> indicates the number of coins in the vertex <code>i</code>, and an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nStarting from the root, you have to collect all the coins such that the coins at a node can only be collected if the coins of its ancestors have been already collected.\n\nCoins at <code>node<sub>i</sub></code> can be collected in one of the following ways:\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum points</strong> you can get after collecting the coins from <strong>all</strong> the tree nodes.</em>\n\n",
