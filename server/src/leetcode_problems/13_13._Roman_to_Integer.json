    "description": "Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:&nbsp;<code>I</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>M</code>.\n\nFor example,&nbsp;<code>2</code> is written as <code>II</code>&nbsp;in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. <code>12</code> is written as&nbsp;<code>XII</code>, which is simply <code>X + II</code>. The number <code>27</code> is written as <code>XXVII</code>, which is <code>XX + V + II</code>.\n\nRoman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not <code>IIII</code>. Instead, the number four is written as <code>IV</code>. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as <code>IX</code>. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n\nGiven a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.\n\n",
