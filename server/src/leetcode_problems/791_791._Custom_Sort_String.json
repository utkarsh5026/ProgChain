    "description": "You are given two strings <code>order</code> and <code>s</code>. All the characters of <code>order</code> are <strong>unique</strong> and were sorted in some custom order previously.\n\nPermute the characters of <code>s</code> so that they match the order that <code>order</code> was sorted. More specifically, if a character <code>x</code> occurs before a character <code>y</code> in <code>order</code>, then <code>x</code> should occur before <code>y</code> in the permuted string.\n\nReturn <em>any permutation of </em><code>s</code><em> that satisfies this property</em>.\n\n",
