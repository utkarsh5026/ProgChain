    "description": "You are given an array of unique strings <code>words</code> where <code>words[i]</code> is six letters long. One word of <code>words</code> was chosen as a secret word.\n\nYou are also given the helper object <code>Master</code>. You may call <code>Master.guess(word)</code> where <code>word</code> is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from <code>words</code>. <code>Master.guess(word)</code> returns:\n\nThere is a parameter <code>allowedGuesses</code> for each test case where <code>allowedGuesses</code> is the maximum number of times you can call <code>Master.guess(word)</code>.\n\nFor each test case, you should call <code>Master.guess</code> with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:\n\nThe test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).\n\n",
