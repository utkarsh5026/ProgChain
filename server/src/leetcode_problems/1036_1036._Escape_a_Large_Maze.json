    "description": "There is a 1 million by 1 million grid on an XY-plane, and the coordinates of each grid square are <code>(x, y)</code>.\n\nWe start at the <code>source = [s<sub>x</sub>, s<sub>y</sub>]</code> square and want to reach the <code>target = [t<sub>x</sub>, t<sub>y</sub>]</code> square. There is also an array of <code>blocked</code> squares, where each <code>blocked[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a blocked square with coordinates <code>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code>.\n\nEach move, we can walk one square north, east, south, or west if the square is <strong>not</strong> in the array of <code>blocked</code> squares. We are also not allowed to walk outside of the grid.\n\nReturn <code>true</code><em> if and only if it is possible to reach the </em><code>target</code><em> square from the </em><code>source</code><em> square through a sequence of valid moves</em>.\n\n",
