    "description": "There is an undirected weighted graph with <code>n</code> vertices labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.\n\nYou are given the integer <code>n</code> and an array <code>edges</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between vertices <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> with a weight of <code>w<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nA walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.\n\nThe <strong>cost</strong> of a walk starting at node <code>u</code> and ending at node <code>v</code> is defined as the bitwise <code>AND</code> of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is <code>w<sub>0</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, ..., w<sub>k</sub></code>, then the cost is calculated as <code>w<sub>0</sub> &amp; w<sub>1</sub> &amp; w<sub>2</sub> &amp; ... &amp; w<sub>k</sub></code>, where <code>&amp;</code> denotes the bitwise <code>AND</code> operator.\n\nYou are also given a 2D array <code>query</code>, where <code>query[i] = [s<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>i</sub>]</code>. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex <code>s<sub>i</sub></code> and ending at vertex <code>t<sub>i</sub></code>. If there exists no such walk, the answer is <code>-1</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the array </em><code>answer</code><em>, where </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> denotes the <strong>minimum</strong> cost of a walk for query </em><code>i</code>.\n\n",
