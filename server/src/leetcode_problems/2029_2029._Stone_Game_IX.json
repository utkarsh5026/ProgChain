    "description": "Alice and Bob continue their games with stones. There is a row of n stones, and each stone has an associated value. You are given an integer array <code>stones</code>, where <code>stones[i]</code> is the <strong>value</strong> of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> stone.\n\nAlice and Bob take turns, with <strong>Alice</strong> starting first. On each turn, the player may remove any stone from <code>stones</code>. The player who removes a stone <strong>loses</strong> if the <strong>sum</strong> of the values of <strong>all removed stones</strong> is divisible by <code>3</code>. Bob will win automatically if there are no remaining stones (even if it is Alice's turn).\n\nAssuming both players play <strong>optimally</strong>, return <code>true</code> <em>if Alice wins and</em> <code>false</code> <em>if Bob wins</em>.\n\n",
