    "description": "There is a robot starting at the position <code>(0, 0)</code>, the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot <strong>ends up at </strong><code>(0, 0)</code> after it completes its moves.\n\nYou are given a string <code>moves</code> that represents the move sequence of the robot where <code>moves[i]</code> represents its <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> move. Valid moves are <code>'R'</code> (right), <code>'L'</code> (left), <code>'U'</code> (up), and <code>'D'</code> (down).\n\nReturn <code>true</code><em> if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or </em><code>false</code><em> otherwise</em>.\n\n<strong>Note</strong>: The way that the robot is \"facing\" is irrelevant. <code>'R'</code> will always make the robot move to the right once, <code>'L'</code> will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.\n\n",
