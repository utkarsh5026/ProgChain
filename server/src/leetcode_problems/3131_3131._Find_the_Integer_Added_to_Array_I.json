    "description": "You are given two arrays of equal length, <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code>.\n\nEach element in <code>nums1</code> has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable <code>x</code>.\n\nAs a result, <code>nums1</code> becomes <strong>equal</strong> to <code>nums2</code>. Two arrays are considered <strong>equal</strong> when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.\n\nReturn the integer <code>x</code>.\n\n",
