For a <strong>contiguous</strong> group of wizards (i.e. the wizards' strengths form a <strong>subarray</strong> of <code>strength</code>), the <strong>total strength</strong> is defined as the <strong>product</strong> of the following two values:\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>sum</strong> of the total strengths of <strong>all</strong> contiguous groups of wizards</em>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nA <strong>subarray</strong> is a contiguous <strong>non-empty</strong> sequence of elements within an array.\n\n",
