    "description": "You are given a <strong>directed</strong> graph of <code>n</code> nodes numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>, where each node has <strong>at most one</strong> outgoing edge.\n\nThe graph is represented with a given <strong>0-indexed</strong> array <code>edges</code> of size <code>n</code>, indicating that there is a directed edge from node <code>i</code> to node <code>edges[i]</code>. If there is no outgoing edge from node <code>i</code>, then <code>edges[i] == -1</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the length of the <strong>longest</strong> cycle in the graph</em>. If no cycle exists, return <code>-1</code>.\n\nA cycle is a path that starts and ends at the <strong>same</strong> node.\n\n",
