    "description": "You are given an integer array <code>receiver</code> of length <code>n</code> and an integer <code>k</code>. <code>n</code> players are playing a ball-passing game.\n\nYou choose the starting player, <code>i</code>. The game proceeds as follows: player <code>i</code> passes the ball to player <code>receiver[i]</code>, who then passes it to <code>receiver[receiver[i]]</code>, and so on, for <code>k</code> passes in total. The game's score is the sum of the indices of the players who touched the ball, including repetitions, i.e. <code>i + receiver[i] + receiver[receiver[i]] + ... + receiver<sup>(k)</sup>[i]</code>.\n\nReturn&nbsp;the <strong>maximum</strong>&nbsp;possible score.\n\n<strong>Notes:</strong>\n\n",
