    "description": "A die simulator generates a random number from <code>1</code> to <code>6</code> for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number <code>i</code> more than <code>rollMax[i]</code> (<strong>1-indexed</strong>) consecutive times.\n\nGiven an array of integers <code>rollMax</code> and an integer <code>n</code>, return <em>the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact </em><code>n</code><em> rolls</em>. Since the answer may be too large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nTwo sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.\n\n",
