    "description": "A farmer has a <strong>rectangular grid</strong> of land with <code>m</code> rows and <code>n</code> columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either <strong>fertile</strong> (represented by a <code>1</code>) or <strong>barren</strong> (represented by a <code>0</code>). All cells outside the grid are considered barren.\n\nA <strong>pyramidal plot</strong> of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:\n\nAn <strong>inverse pyramidal plot</strong> of land can be defined as a set of cells with similar criteria:\n\nSome examples of valid and invalid pyramidal (and inverse pyramidal) plots are shown below. Black cells indicate fertile cells.\n\nGiven a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m x n</code> binary matrix <code>grid</code> representing the farmland, return <em>the <strong>total number</strong> of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots that can be found in</em> <code>grid</code>.\n\n",
