    "description": "You are given an integer <code>n</code> indicating there are <code>n</code> people numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>meetings</code> where <code>meetings[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that person <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and person <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> have a meeting at <code>time<sub>i</sub></code>. A person may attend <strong>multiple meetings</strong> at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer <code>firstPerson</code>.\n\nPerson <code>0</code> has a <strong>secret</strong> and initially shares the secret with a person <code>firstPerson</code> at time <code>0</code>. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> has the secret at <code>time<sub>i</sub></code>, then they will share the secret with person <code>y<sub>i</sub></code>, and vice versa.\n\nThe secrets are shared <strong>instantaneously</strong>. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.\n\nReturn <em>a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. </em>You may return the answer in <strong>any order</strong>.\n\n",
