    "description": "You are given a string <code>word</code> containing <strong>distinct</strong> lowercase English letters.\n\nTelephone keypads have keys mapped with <strong>distinct</strong> collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key <code>2</code> is mapped with <code>[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"]</code>, we need to push the key one time to type <code>\"a\"</code>, two times to type <code>\"b\"</code>, and three times to type <code>\"c\"</code> <em>.</em>\n\nIt is allowed to remap the keys numbered <code>2</code> to <code>9</code> to <strong>distinct</strong> collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to <strong>any</strong> amount of letters, but each letter <strong>must</strong> be mapped to <strong>exactly</strong> one key. You need to find the <strong>minimum</strong> number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string <code>word</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of pushes needed to type </em><code>word</code> <em>after remapping the keys</em>.\n\nAn example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that <code>1</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>#</code>, and <code>0</code> do <strong>not</strong> map to any letters.\n\n",
