    "description": "You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point <code>[0, 0]</code>, and you are given a destination point <code>target = [x<sub>target</sub>, y<sub>target</sub>]</code> that you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as a 2D array <code>ghosts</code>, where <code>ghosts[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the starting position of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> ghost. All inputs are <strong>integral coordinates</strong>.\n\nEach turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either <strong>move 1 unit</strong> in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west, or <strong>stay still</strong>. All actions happen <strong>simultaneously</strong>.\n\nYou escape if and only if you can reach the target <strong>before</strong> any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the <strong>same time</strong> as a ghost, it <strong>does not</strong> count as an escape.\n\nReturn <code>true</code><em> if it is possible to escape regardless of how the ghosts move, otherwise return </em><code>false</code><em>.</em>\n\n",
