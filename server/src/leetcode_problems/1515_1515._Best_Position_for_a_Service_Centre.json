The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new center in a position such that <strong>the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum</strong>.\n\nGiven an array <code>positions</code> where <code>positions[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>]</code> is the position of the <code>ith</code> customer on the map, return <em>the minimum sum of the euclidean distances</em> to all customers.\n\nIn other words, you need to choose the position of the service center <code>[x<sub>centre</sub>, y<sub>centre</sub>]</code> such that the following formula is minimized:\n\nAnswers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual value will be accepted.\n\n",
