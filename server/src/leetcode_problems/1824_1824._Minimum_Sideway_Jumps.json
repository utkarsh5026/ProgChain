    "description": "There is a <strong>3 lane road</strong> of length <code>n</code> that consists of <code>n + 1</code> <strong>points</strong> labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n</code>. A frog <strong>starts</strong> at point <code>0</code> in the <strong>second </strong>lane<strong> </strong>and wants to jump to point <code>n</code>. However, there could be obstacles along the way.\n\nYou are given an array <code>obstacles</code> of length <code>n + 1</code> where each <code>obstacles[i]</code> (<strong>ranging from 0 to 3</strong>) describes an obstacle on the lane <code>obstacles[i]</code> at point <code>i</code>. If <code>obstacles[i] == 0</code>, there are no obstacles at point <code>i</code>. There will be <strong>at most one</strong> obstacle in the 3 lanes at each point.\n\nThe frog can only travel from point <code>i</code> to point <code>i + 1</code> on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point <code>i + 1</code>. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a <strong>side jump</strong> to jump to <strong>another</strong> lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the <strong>same</strong> point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.\n\nReturn<em> the <strong>minimum number of side jumps</strong> the frog needs to reach <strong>any lane</strong> at point n starting from lane <code>2</code> at point 0.</em>\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> There will be no obstacles on points <code>0</code> and <code>n</code>.\n\n",
