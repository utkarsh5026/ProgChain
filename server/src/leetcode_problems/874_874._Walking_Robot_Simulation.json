    "description": "A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point <code>(0, 0)</code> facing north. The robot receives an array of integers <code>commands</code>, which represents a sequence of moves that it needs to execute. There are only three possible types of instructions the robot can receive:\n\nSome of the grid squares are <code>obstacles</code>. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> obstacle is at grid point <code>obstacles[i] = (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</code>. If the robot runs into an obstacle, it will stay in its current location (on the block adjacent to the obstacle) and move onto the next command.\n\nReturn the <strong>maximum squared Euclidean distance</strong> that the robot reaches at any point in its path (i.e. if the distance is <code>5</code>, return <code>25</code>).\n\n<strong>Note:</strong>\n\n",
