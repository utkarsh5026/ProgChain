    "description": "You are given a string <code>s</code> of <strong>even length</strong> consisting of digits from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>, and two integers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.\n\nYou can apply either of the following two operations any number of times and in any order on <code>s</code>:\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>lexicographically smallest</strong> string you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on</em> <code>s</code>.\n\nA string <code>a</code> is lexicographically smaller than a string <code>b</code> (of the same length) if in the first position where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> differ, string <code>a</code> has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in <code>b</code>. For example, <code>\"0158\"</code> is lexicographically smaller than <code>\"0190\"</code> because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and <code>'5'</code> comes before <code>'9'</code>.\n\n",
