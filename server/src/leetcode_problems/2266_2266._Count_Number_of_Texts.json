    "description": "Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The <strong>mapping</strong> of digits to letters is shown in the figure below.\n\nIn order to <strong>add</strong> a letter, Alice has to <strong>press</strong> the key of the corresponding digit <code>i</code> times, where <code>i</code> is the position of the letter in the key.\n\nHowever, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a <strong>string of pressed keys</strong> instead.\n\nGiven a string <code>pressedKeys</code> representing the string received by Bob, return <em>the <strong>total number of possible text messages</strong> Alice could have sent</em>.\n\nSince the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
