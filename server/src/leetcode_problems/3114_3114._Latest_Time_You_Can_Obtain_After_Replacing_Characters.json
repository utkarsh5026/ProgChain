    "description": "You are given a string <code>s</code> representing a 12-hour format time where some of the digits (possibly none) are replaced with a <code>\"?\"</code>.\n\n12-hour times are formatted as <code>\"HH:MM\"</code>, where <code>HH</code> is between <code>00</code> and <code>11</code>, and <code>MM</code> is between <code>00</code> and <code>59</code>. The earliest 12-hour time is <code>00:00</code>, and the latest is <code>11:59</code>.\n\nYou have to replace <strong>all</strong> the <code>\"?\"</code> characters in <code>s</code> with digits such that the time we obtain by the resulting string is a <strong>valid</strong> 12-hour format time and is the <strong>latest</strong> possible.\n\nReturn <em>the resulting string</em>.\n\n",
