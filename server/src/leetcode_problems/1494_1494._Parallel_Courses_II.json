You are also given an array <code>relations</code> where <code>relations[i] = [prevCourse<sub>i</sub>, nextCourse<sub>i</sub>]</code>, representing a prerequisite relationship between course <code>prevCourse<sub>i</sub></code> and course <code>nextCourse<sub>i</sub></code>: course <code>prevCourse<sub>i</sub></code> has to be taken before course <code>nextCourse<sub>i</sub></code>. Also, you are given the integer <code>k</code>.\n\nIn one semester, you can take <strong>at most</strong> <code>k</code> courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the <strong>previous</strong> semesters for the courses you are taking.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of semesters needed to take all courses</em>. The testcases will be generated such that it is possible to take every course.\n\n",
