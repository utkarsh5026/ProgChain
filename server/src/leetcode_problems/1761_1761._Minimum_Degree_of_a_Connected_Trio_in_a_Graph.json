    "description": "You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer <code>n</code> which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array <code>edges</code>, where each <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an undirected edge between <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nA <strong>connected trio</strong> is a set of <strong>three</strong> nodes where there is an edge between <b>every</b> pair of them.\n\nThe <strong>degree of a connected trio</strong> is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> degree of a connected trio in the graph, or</em> <code>-1</code> <em>if the graph has no connected trios.</em>\n\n",
