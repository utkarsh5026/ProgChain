    "description": "There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>s</code> consisting of characters <code>'*'</code> and <code>'|'</code> only, where a <code>'*'</code> represents a <strong>plate</strong> and a <code>'|'</code> represents a <strong>candle</strong>.\n\nYou are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>queries</code> where <code>queries[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the <strong>substring</strong> <code>s[left<sub>i</sub>...right<sub>i</sub>]</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>). For each query, you need to find the <strong>number</strong> of plates <strong>between candles</strong> that are <strong>in the substring</strong>. A plate is considered <strong>between candles</strong> if there is at least one candle to its left <strong>and</strong> at least one candle to its right <strong>in the substring</strong>.\n\nReturn <em>an integer array</em> <code>answer</code> <em>where</em> <code>answer[i]</code> <em>is the answer to the</em> <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> <em>query</em>.\n\n",
