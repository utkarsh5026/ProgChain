    "description": "You wrote down many <strong>positive</strong> integers in a string called <code>num</code>. However, you realized that you forgot to add commas to seperate the different numbers. You remember that the list of integers was <strong>non-decreasing</strong> and that <strong>no</strong> integer had leading zeros.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>number of possible lists of integers</strong> that you could have written down to get the string </em><code>num</code>. Since the answer may be large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
