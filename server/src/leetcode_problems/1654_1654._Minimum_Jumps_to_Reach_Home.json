Help them get there from position <code>0</code>.\n\nThe bug jumps according to the following rules:\n\nThe bug may jump forward <strong>beyond</strong> its home, but it <strong>cannot jump</strong> to positions numbered with <strong>negative</strong> integers.\n\nGiven an array of integers <code>forbidden</code>, where <code>forbidden[i]</code> means that the bug cannot jump to the position <code>forbidden[i]</code>, and integers <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>x</code>, return <em>the minimum number of jumps needed for the bug to reach its home</em>. If there is no possible sequence of jumps that lands the bug on position <code>x</code>, return <code>-1.</code>\n\n",
