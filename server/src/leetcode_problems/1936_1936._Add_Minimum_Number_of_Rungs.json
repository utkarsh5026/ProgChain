You are currently on the <strong>floor</strong> at height <code>0</code>, and you want to reach the last rung.\n\nYou are also given an integer <code>dist</code>. You can only climb to the next highest rung if the distance between where you are currently at (the floor or on a rung) and the next rung is <strong>at most</strong> <code>dist</code>. You are able to insert rungs at any positive <strong>integer</strong> height if a rung is not already there.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of rungs that must be added to the ladder in order for you to climb to the last rung.</em>\n\n",
