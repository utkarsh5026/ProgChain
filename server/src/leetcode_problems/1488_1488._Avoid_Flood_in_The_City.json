    "description": "Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the <code>nth</code> lake, the <code>nth</code> lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is <strong>full of water</strong>, there will be a <strong>flood</strong>. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.\n\nGiven an integer array <code>rains</code> where:\n\nReturn <em>an array <code>ans</code></em> where:\n\nIf there are multiple valid answers return <strong>any</strong> of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return <strong>an empty array</strong>.\n\nNotice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.\n\n",
