    "description": "You are given two integer arrays <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code>. We write the integers of <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code> (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.\n\nWe may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers <code>nums1[i]</code> and <code>nums2[j]</code> such that:\n\nNote that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).\n\nReturn <em>the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way</em>.\n\n",
