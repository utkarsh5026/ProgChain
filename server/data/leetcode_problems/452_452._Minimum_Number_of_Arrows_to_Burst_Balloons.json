    "description": "There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array <code>points</code> where <code>points[i] = [x<sub>start</sub>, x<sub>end</sub>]</code> denotes a balloon whose <strong>horizontal diameter</strong> stretches between <code>x<sub>start</sub></code> and <code>x<sub>end</sub></code>. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.\n\nArrows can be shot up <strong>directly vertically</strong> (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with <code>x<sub>start</sub></code> and <code>x<sub>end</sub></code> is <strong>burst</strong> by an arrow shot at <code>x</code> if <code>x<sub>start</sub> &lt;= x &lt;= x<sub>end</sub></code>. There is <strong>no limit</strong> to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.\n\nGiven the array <code>points</code>, return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons</em>.\n\n",
