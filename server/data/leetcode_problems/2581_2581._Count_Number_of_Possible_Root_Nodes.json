    "description": "Alice has an undirected tree with <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. The tree is represented as a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.\n\nAlice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several <strong>guesses</strong> about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:\n\nBob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array <code>guesses</code> where <code>guesses[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates Bob guessed <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> to be the parent of <code>v<sub>j</sub></code>.\n\nAlice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that <strong>at least</strong> <code>k</code> of his guesses are <code>true</code>.\n\nGiven the 2D integer arrays <code>edges</code>, <code>guesses</code> and the integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the <strong>number of possible nodes</strong> that can be the root of Alice's tree</em>. If there is no such tree, return <code>0</code>.\n\n",
