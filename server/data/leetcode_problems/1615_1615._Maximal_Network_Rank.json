    "description": "There is an infrastructure of <code>n</code> cities with some number of <code>roads</code> connecting these cities. Each <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nThe <strong>network rank</strong><em> </em>of <strong>two different cities</strong> is defined as the total number of&nbsp;<strong>directly</strong> connected roads to <strong>either</strong> city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted <strong>once</strong>.\n\nThe <strong>maximal network rank </strong>of the infrastructure is the <strong>maximum network rank</strong> of all pairs of different cities.\n\nGiven the integer <code>n</code> and the array <code>roads</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximal network rank</strong> of the entire infrastructure</em>.\n\n",
