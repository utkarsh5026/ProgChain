    "description": "You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the <strong>sum</strong> of scores of all the players in the team.\n\nHowever, the basketball team is not allowed to have <strong>conflicts</strong>. A <strong>conflict</strong> exists if a younger player has a <strong>strictly higher</strong> score than an older player. A conflict does <strong>not</strong> occur between players of the same age.\n\nGiven two lists, <code>scores</code> and <code>ages</code>, where each <code>scores[i]</code> and <code>ages[i]</code> represents the score and age of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> player, respectively, return <em>the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams</em>.\n\n",
