    "description": "There is a <strong>simple directed graph</strong> with <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. The graph would form a <strong>tree</strong> if its edges were bi-directional.\n\nYou are given an integer <code>n</code> and a <strong>2D</strong> integer array <code>edges</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a <strong>directed edge</strong> going from node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nAn <strong>edge reversal</strong> changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going from node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> becomes a directed edge going from node <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> to node <code>u<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nFor every node <code>i</code> in the range <code>[0, n - 1]</code>, your task is to <strong>independently</strong> calculate the <strong>minimum</strong> number of <strong>edge reversals</strong> required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node <code>i</code> through a <strong>sequence</strong> of <strong>directed edges</strong>.\n\nReturn <em>an integer array </em><code>answer</code><em>, where </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> is the</em><em> </em> <em><strong>minimum</strong> number of <strong>edge reversals</strong> required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node </em><code>i</code><em> through a <strong>sequence</strong> of <strong>directed edges</strong>.</em>\n\n",
