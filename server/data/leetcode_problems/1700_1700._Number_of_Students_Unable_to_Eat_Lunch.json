    "description": "The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.\n\nThe number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a <strong>stack</strong>. At each step:\n\nThis continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.\n\nYou are given two integer arrays <code>students</code> and <code>sandwiches</code> where <code>sandwiches[i]</code> is the type of the <code>i<sup>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bth</sup></code> sandwich in the stack (<code>i = 0</code> is the top of the stack) and <code>students[j]</code> is the preference of the <code>j<sup>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bth</sup></code> student in the initial queue (<code>j = 0</code> is the front of the queue). Return <em>the number of students that are unable to eat.</em>\n\n",
