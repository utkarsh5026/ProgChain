    "description": "Given two integers <code>dividend</code> and <code>divisor</code>, divide two integers <strong>without</strong> using multiplication, division, and mod operator.\n\nThe integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, <code>8.345</code> would be truncated to <code>8</code>, and <code>-2.7335</code> would be truncated to <code>-2</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>quotient</strong> after dividing </em><code>dividend</code><em> by </em><code>divisor</code>.\n\n<strong>Note: </strong>Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the <strong>32-bit</strong> signed integer range: <code>[\u22122<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> \u2212 1]</code>. For this problem, if the quotient is <strong>strictly greater than</strong> <code>2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>, then return <code>2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>, and if the quotient is <strong>strictly less than</strong> <code>-2<sup>31</sup></code>, then return <code>-2<sup>31</sup></code>.\n\n",
