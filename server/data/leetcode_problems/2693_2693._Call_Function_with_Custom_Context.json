    "description": "Enhance all functions to have the&nbsp;<code>callPolyfill</code>&nbsp;method. The method accepts an object&nbsp;<code>obj</code>&nbsp;as it's first parameter and any number of additional arguments. The&nbsp;<code>obj</code>&nbsp;becomes the&nbsp;<code>this</code>&nbsp;context for the function. The additional arguments are passed to the function (that the <code>callPolyfill</code>&nbsp;method belongs on).\n\nFor example if you had the function:\n\nCalling this function like&nbsp;<code>tax(10, 0.1)</code>&nbsp;will log&nbsp;<code>\"The cost of undefined is 11\"</code>. This is because the&nbsp;<code>this</code>&nbsp;context was not defined.\n\nHowever, calling the function like&nbsp;<code>tax.callPolyfill({item: \"salad\"}, 10, 0.1)</code>&nbsp;will log&nbsp;<code>\"The cost of salad is 11\"</code>. The&nbsp;<code>this</code>&nbsp;context was appropriately set, and the function logged an appropriate output.\n\nPlease solve this without using&nbsp;the built-in&nbsp;<code>Function.call</code>&nbsp;method.\n\n",
