You are given&nbsp;a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.\n\nYou are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>values</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>values[i]</code> is the <strong>value</strong> associated with the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node.\n\nYou start with a score of <code>0</code>. In one operation, you can:\n\nA tree is <strong>healthy</strong> if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf node is different than zero.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum score</strong> you can obtain after performing these operations on the tree any number of times so that it remains <strong>healthy</strong>.</em>\n\n",
