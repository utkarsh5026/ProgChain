    "description": "There are <code>n</code> cars on an infinitely long road. The cars are numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> from left to right and each car is present at a <strong>unique</strong> point.\n\nYou are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>directions</code> of length <code>n</code>. <code>directions[i]</code> can be either <code>'L'</code>, <code>'R'</code>, or <code>'S'</code> denoting whether the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car is moving towards the <strong>left</strong>, towards the <strong>right</strong>, or <strong>staying</strong> at its current point respectively. Each moving car has the <strong>same speed</strong>.\n\nThe number of collisions can be calculated as follows:\n\nAfter a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>total number of collisions</strong> that will happen on the road</em>.\n\n",
