    "description": "Alice had a <strong>0-indexed</strong> array <code>arr</code> consisting of <code>n</code> <strong>positive</strong> integers. She chose an arbitrary <strong>positive integer</strong> <code>k</code> and created two new <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>lower</code> and <code>higher</code> in the following manner:\n\nUnfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays <code>lower</code> and <code>higher</code>, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.\n\nGiven an array <code>nums</code> consisting of <code>2n</code> integers, where <strong>exactly</strong> <code>n</code> of the integers were present in <code>lower</code> and the remaining in <code>higher</code>, return <em>the <strong>original</strong> array</em> <code>arr</code>. In case the answer is not unique, return <em><strong>any</strong> valid array</em>.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> The test cases are generated such that there exists <strong>at least one</strong> valid array <code>arr</code>.\n\n",
