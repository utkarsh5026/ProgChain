    "description": "You are working in a ball factory where you have <code>n</code> balls numbered from <code>lowLimit</code> up to <code>highLimit</code> <strong>inclusive</strong> (i.e., <code>n == highLimit - lowLimit + 1</code>), and an infinite number of boxes numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>infinity</code>.\n\nYour job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number. For example, the ball number <code>321</code> will be put in the box number <code>3 + 2 + 1 = 6</code> and the ball number <code>10</code> will be put in the box number <code>1 + 0 = 1</code>.\n\nGiven two integers <code>lowLimit</code> and <code>highLimit</code>, return<em> the number of balls in the box with the most balls.</em>\n\n",
