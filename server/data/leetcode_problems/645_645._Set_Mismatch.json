    "description": "You have a set of integers <code>s</code>, which originally contains all the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in <code>s</code> got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in <strong>repetition of one</strong> number and <strong>loss of another</strong> number.\n\nYou are given an integer array <code>nums</code> representing the data status of this set after the error.\n\nFind the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return <em>them in the form of an array</em>.\n\n",
