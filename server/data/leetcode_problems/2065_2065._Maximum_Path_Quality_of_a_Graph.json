    "description": "There is an <strong>undirected</strong> graph with <code>n</code> nodes numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>). You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>values</code> where <code>values[i]</code> is the <strong>value </strong>of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node. You are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>edges</code>, where each <code>edges[j] = [u<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>, time<sub>j</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an undirected edge between the nodes <code>u<sub>j</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>j</sub></code>,<sub> </sub>and it takes <code>time<sub>j</sub></code> seconds to travel between the two nodes. Finally, you are given an integer <code>maxTime</code>.\n\nA <strong>valid</strong> <strong>path</strong> in the graph is any path that starts at node <code>0</code>, ends at node <code>0</code>, and takes <strong>at most</strong> <code>maxTime</code> seconds to complete. You may visit the same node multiple times. The <strong>quality</strong> of a valid path is the <strong>sum</strong> of the values of the <strong>unique nodes</strong> visited in the path (each node's value is added <strong>at most once</strong> to the sum).\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> quality of a valid path</em>.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> There are <strong>at most four</strong> edges connected to each node.\n\n",
