    "description": "You are given a string <code>s</code> of lowercase English letters and an array <code>widths</code> denoting <strong>how many pixels wide</strong> each lowercase English letter is. Specifically, <code>widths[0]</code> is the width of <code>'a'</code>, <code>widths[1]</code> is the width of <code>'b'</code>, and so on.\n\nYou are trying to write <code>s</code> across several lines, where <strong>each line is no longer than </strong><code>100</code><strong> pixels</strong>. Starting at the beginning of <code>s</code>, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed <code>100</code> pixels. Then, from where you stopped in <code>s</code>, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of <code>s</code>.\n\nReturn <em>an array </em><code>result</code><em> of length 2 where:</em>\n\n",
