    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>nums</code> and an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nYou are initially standing at index <code>0</code>. In one move, you can jump at most <code>k</code> steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index <code>i</code> to any index in the range <code>[i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)]</code> <strong>inclusive</strong>.\n\nYou want to reach the last index of the array (index <code>n - 1</code>). Your <strong>score</strong> is the <strong>sum</strong> of all <code>nums[j]</code> for each index <code>j</code> you visited in the array.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum score</strong> you can get</em>.\n\n",
