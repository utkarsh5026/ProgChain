    "description": "There is a <strong>1-based</strong> binary matrix where <code>0</code> represents land and <code>1</code> represents water. You are given integers <code>row</code> and <code>col</code> representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.\n\nInitially on day <code>0</code>, the <strong>entire</strong> matrix is <strong>land</strong>. However, each day a new cell becomes flooded with <strong>water</strong>. You are given a <strong>1-based</strong> 2D array <code>cells</code>, where <code>cells[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents that on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day, the cell on the <code>r<sub>i</sub><sup>th</sup></code> row and <code>c<sub>i</sub><sup>th</sup></code> column (<strong>1-based</strong> coordinates) will be covered with <strong>water</strong> (i.e., changed to <code>1</code>).\n\nYou want to find the <strong>last</strong> day that it is possible to walk from the <strong>top</strong> to the <strong>bottom</strong> by only walking on land cells. You can start from <strong>any</strong> cell in the top row and end at <strong>any</strong> cell in the bottom row. You can only travel in the<strong> four</strong> cardinal directions (left, right, up, and down).\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>last</strong> day where it is possible to walk from the <strong>top</strong> to the <strong>bottom</strong> by only walking on land cells</em>.\n\n",
