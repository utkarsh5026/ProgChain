That is, for each node, find the value of the first node that is next to it and has a <strong>strictly larger</strong> value than it.\n\nReturn an integer array <code>answer</code> where <code>answer[i]</code> is the value of the next greater node of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node (<strong>1-indexed</strong>). If the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node does not have a next greater node, set <code>answer[i] = 0</code>.\n\n",
