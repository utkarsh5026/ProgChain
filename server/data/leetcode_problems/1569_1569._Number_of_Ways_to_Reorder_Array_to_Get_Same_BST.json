    "description": "Given an array <code>nums</code> that represents a permutation of integers from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements of <code>nums</code> in order into an initially empty BST. Find the number of different ways to reorder <code>nums</code> so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array <code>nums</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the number of ways to reorder</em> <code>nums</code> <em>such that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from</em> <code>nums</code>.\n\nSince the answer may be very large, <strong>return it modulo </strong><code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
