    "description": "A <strong>wiggle sequence</strong> is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.\n\nGiven an integer array <code>nums</code>, return <em>the length of the longest <strong>wiggle subsequence</strong> of </em><code>nums</code>.\n\n",
