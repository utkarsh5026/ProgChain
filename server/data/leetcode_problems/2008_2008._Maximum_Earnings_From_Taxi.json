    "description": "There are <code>n</code> points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The <code>n</code> points on the road are labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point <code>1</code> to point <code>n</code> to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.\n\nThe passengers are represented by a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>rides</code>, where <code>rides[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, tip<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> passenger requesting a ride from point <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> to point <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> who is willing to give a <code>tip<sub>i</sub></code> dollar tip.\n\nFor<strong> each </strong>passenger <code>i</code> you pick up, you <strong>earn</strong> <code>end<sub>i</sub> - start<sub>i</sub> + tip<sub>i</sub></code> dollars. You may only drive <b>at most one </b>passenger at a time.\n\nGiven <code>n</code> and <code>rides</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally.</em>\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.\n\n",
