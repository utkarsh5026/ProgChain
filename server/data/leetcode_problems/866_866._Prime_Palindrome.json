    "description": "Given an integer n, return <em>the smallest <strong>prime palindrome</strong> greater than or equal to </em><code>n</code>.\n\nAn integer is <strong>prime</strong> if it has exactly two divisors: <code>1</code> and itself. Note that <code>1</code> is not a prime number.\n\nAn integer is a <strong>palindrome</strong> if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.\n\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer always exists and is in the range <code>[2, 2 * 10<sup>8</sup>]</code>.\n\n",
