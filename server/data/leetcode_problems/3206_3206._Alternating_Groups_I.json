The color of tile <code>i</code> is represented by <code>colors[i]</code>:\n\nEvery 3 contiguous tiles in the circle with <strong>alternating</strong> colors (the middle tile has a different color from its <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right</strong> tiles) is called an <strong>alternating</strong> group.\n\nReturn the number of <strong>alternating</strong> groups.\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that since <code>colors</code> represents a <strong>circle</strong>, the <strong>first</strong> and the <strong>last</strong> tiles are considered to be next to each other.\n\n",
