    "description": "You are given an <code>m x n</code> integer matrix <code>grid</code>\u200b\u200b\u200b, where <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are both <strong>even</strong> integers, and an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nThe matrix is composed of several layers, which is shown in the below image, where each color is its own layer:\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/10/ringofgrid.png\" style=\"width: 231px; height: 258px;\">\n\nA cyclic rotation of the matrix is done by cyclically rotating <strong>each layer</strong> in the matrix. To cyclically rotate a layer once, each element in the layer will take the place of the adjacent element in the <strong>counter-clockwise</strong> direction. An example rotation is shown below:\n\nReturn <em>the matrix after applying </em><code>k</code> <em>cyclic rotations to it</em>.\n\n",
