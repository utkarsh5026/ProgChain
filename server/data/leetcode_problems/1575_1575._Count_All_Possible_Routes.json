    "description": "You are given an array of <strong>distinct</strong> positive integers locations where <code>locations[i]</code> represents the position of city <code>i</code>. You are also given integers <code>start</code>, <code>finish</code> and <code>fuel</code> representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.\n\nAt each step, if you are at city <code>i</code>, you can pick any city <code>j</code> such that <code>j != i</code> and <code>0 &lt;= j &lt; locations.length</code> and move to city <code>j</code>. Moving from city <code>i</code> to city <code>j</code> reduces the amount of fuel you have by <code>|locations[i] - locations[j]|</code>. Please notice that <code>|x|</code> denotes the absolute value of <code>x</code>.\n\nNotice that <code>fuel</code> <strong>cannot</strong> become negative at any point in time, and that you are <strong>allowed</strong> to visit any city more than once (including <code>start</code> and <code>finish</code>).\n\nReturn <em>the count of all possible routes from </em><code>start</code> <em>to</em> <code>finish</code>. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
