    "description": "You are given two integers <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> that represent the height and width of a rectangular piece of wood. You are also given a 2D integer array <code>prices</code>, where <code>prices[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height <code>h<sub>i</sub></code> and width <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> for <code>price<sub>i</sub></code> dollars.\n\nTo cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the <strong>entire</strong> height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to <code>prices</code>. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you <strong>cannot</strong> rotate a piece to swap its height and width.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> money you can earn after cutting an </em><code>m x n</code><em> piece of wood</em>.\n\nNote that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.\n\n",
