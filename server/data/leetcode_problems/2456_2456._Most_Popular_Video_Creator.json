    "description": "You are given two string arrays <code>creators</code> and <code>ids</code>, and an integer array <code>views</code>, all of length <code>n</code>. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> video on a platform was created by <code>creators[i]</code>, has an id of <code>ids[i]</code>, and has <code>views[i]</code> views.\n\nThe <strong>popularity</strong> of a creator is the <strong>sum</strong> of the number of views on <strong>all</strong> of the creator's videos. Find the creator with the <strong>highest</strong> popularity and the id of their <strong>most</strong> viewed video.\n\nNote: It is possible for different videos to have the same <code>id</code>, meaning that <code>id</code>s do not uniquely identify a video. For example, two videos with the same ID are considered as distinct videos with their own viewcount.\n\nReturn<em> </em>a <strong>2D array</strong> of <strong>strings</strong> <code>answer</code> where <code>answer[i] = [creators<sub>i</sub>, id<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that <code>creators<sub>i</sub></code> has the <strong>highest</strong> popularity and <code>id<sub>i</sub></code> is the <strong>id</strong> of their most <strong>popular</strong> video. The answer can be returned in any order.\n\n",
