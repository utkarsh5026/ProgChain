    "description": "You are given an <code>m x n</code> matrix of characters <code>box</code> representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:\n\nThe box is rotated <strong>90 degrees clockwise</strong>, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity <strong>does not</strong> affect the obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation <strong>does not </strong>affect the stones' horizontal positions.\n\nIt is <strong>guaranteed</strong> that each stone in <code>box</code> rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.\n\nReturn <em>an </em><code>n x m</code><em> matrix representing the box after the rotation described above</em>.\n\n",
