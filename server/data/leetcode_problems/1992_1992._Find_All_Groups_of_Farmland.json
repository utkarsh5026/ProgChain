    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m x n</code> binary matrix <code>land</code> where a <code>0</code> represents a hectare of forested land and a <code>1</code> represents a hectare of farmland.\n\nTo keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist <strong>entirely</strong> of farmland. These rectangular areas are called <strong>groups</strong>. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is <strong>not</strong> four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.\n\n<code>land</code> can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of <code>land</code> is <code>(0, 0)</code> and the bottom right corner of <code>land</code> is <code>(m-1, n-1)</code>. Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each <strong>group</strong> of farmland. A <strong>group</strong> of farmland with a top left corner at <code>(r<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>)</code> and a bottom right corner at <code>(r<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>)</code> is represented by the 4-length array <code>[r<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>].</code>\n\nReturn <em>a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each <strong>group</strong> of farmland in </em><code>land</code><em>. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in <strong>any order</strong></em>.\n\n",
