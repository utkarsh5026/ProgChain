    "description": "You are given an array of equal-length strings <code>words</code>. Assume that the length of each string is <code>n</code>.\n\nEach string <code>words[i]</code> can be converted into a <strong>difference integer array</strong> <code>difference[i]</code> of length <code>n - 1</code> where <code>difference[i][j] = words[i][j+1] - words[i][j]</code> where <code>0 &lt;= j &lt;= n - 2</code>. Note that the difference between two letters is the difference between their <strong>positions</strong> in the alphabet i.e.&nbsp;the position of <code>'a'</code> is <code>0</code>, <code>'b'</code> is <code>1</code>, and <code>'z'</code> is <code>25</code>.\n\nAll the strings in words have the same difference integer array, <strong>except one</strong>. You should find that string.\n\nReturn<em> the string in </em><code>words</code><em> that has different <strong>difference integer array</strong>.</em>\n\n",
