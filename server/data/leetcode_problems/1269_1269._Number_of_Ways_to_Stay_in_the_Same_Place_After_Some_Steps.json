    "description": "You have a pointer at index <code>0</code> in an array of size <code>arrLen</code>. At each step, you can move 1 position to the left, 1 position to the right in the array, or stay in the same place (The pointer should not be placed outside the array at any time).\n\nGiven two integers <code>steps</code> and <code>arrLen</code>, return the number of ways such that your pointer is still at index <code>0</code> after <strong>exactly</strong> <code>steps</code> steps. Since the answer may be too large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
