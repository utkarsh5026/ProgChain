    "description": "<strong>Tic-tac-toe</strong> is played by two players <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> on a <code>3 x 3</code> grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:\n\nGiven a 2D integer array <code>moves</code> where <code>moves[i] = [row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> move will be played on <code>grid[row<sub>i</sub>][col<sub>i</sub>]</code>. return <em>the winner of the game if it exists</em> (<code>A</code> or <code>B</code>). In case the game ends in a draw return <code>\"Draw\"</code>. If there are still movements to play return <code>\"Pending\"</code>.\n\nYou can assume that <code>moves</code> is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of <strong>Tic-Tac-Toe</strong>), the grid is initially empty, and <code>A</code> will play first.\n\n",
