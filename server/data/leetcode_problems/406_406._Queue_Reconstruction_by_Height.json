Each <code>people[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person of height <code>h<sub>i</sub></code> with <strong>exactly</strong> <code>k<sub>i</sub></code> other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to <code>h<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nReconstruct and return <em>the queue that is represented by the input array </em><code>people</code>. The returned queue should be formatted as an array <code>queue</code>, where <code>queue[j] = [h<sub>j</sub>, k<sub>j</sub>]</code> is the attributes of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> person in the queue (<code>queue[0]</code> is the person at the front of the queue).\n\n",
