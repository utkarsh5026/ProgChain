    "description": "You are given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>p</code> where <code>p</code> is a <strong>subsequence </strong>of <code>s</code>. You are also given a <strong>distinct 0-indexed </strong>integer array <code>removable</code> containing a subset of indices of <code>s</code> (<code>s</code> is also <strong>0-indexed</strong>).\n\nYou want to choose an integer <code>k</code> (<code>0 &lt;= k &lt;= removable.length</code>) such that, after removing <code>k</code> characters from <code>s</code> using the <strong>first</strong> <code>k</code> indices in <code>removable</code>, <code>p</code> is still a <strong>subsequence</strong> of <code>s</code>. More formally, you will mark the character at <code>s[removable[i]]</code> for each <code>0 &lt;= i &lt; k</code>, then remove all marked characters and check if <code>p</code> is still a subsequence.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> </em><code>k</code><em> you can choose such that </em><code>p</code><em> is still a <strong>subsequence</strong> of </em><code>s</code><em> after the removals</em>.\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n\n",
