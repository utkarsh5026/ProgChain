    "description": "Alice and Bob want to water <code>n</code> plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> from left to right where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plant is located at <code>x = i</code>.\n\nEach plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, <strong>initially full</strong>. They water the plants in the following way:\n\nGiven a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>plants</code> of <code>n</code> integers, where <code>plants[i]</code> is the amount of water the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plant needs, and two integers <code>capacityA</code> and <code>capacityB</code> representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return <em>the <strong>number of times</strong> they have to refill to water all the plants</em>.\n\n",
