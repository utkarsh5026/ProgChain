    "description": "A social media company is trying to monitor activity on their site by analyzing the number of tweets that occur in select periods of time. These periods can be partitioned into smaller <strong>time chunks</strong> based on a certain frequency (every <strong>minute</strong>, <strong>hour</strong>, or <strong>day</strong>).\n\nFor example, the period <code>[10, 10000]</code> (in <strong>seconds</strong>) would be partitioned into the following <strong>time chunks</strong> with these frequencies:\n\nNotice that the last chunk may be shorter than the specified frequency's chunk size and will always end with the end time of the period (<code>10000</code> in the above example).\n\nDesign and implement an API to help the company with their analysis.\n\nImplement the <code>TweetCounts</code> class:\n\n",
