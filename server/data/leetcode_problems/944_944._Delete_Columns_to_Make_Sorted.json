    "description": "You are given an array of <code>n</code> strings <code>strs</code>, all of the same length.\n\nThe strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.\n\nYou want to <strong>delete</strong> the columns that are <strong>not sorted lexicographically</strong>. In the above example (<strong>0-indexed</strong>), columns 0 (<code>'a'</code>, <code>'b'</code>, <code>'c'</code>) and 2 (<code>'c'</code>, <code>'e'</code>, <code>'e'</code>) are sorted, while column 1 (<code>'b'</code>, <code>'c'</code>, <code>'a'</code>) is not, so you would delete column 1.\n\nReturn <em>the number of columns that you will delete</em>.\n\n",
