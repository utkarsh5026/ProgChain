    "description": "Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.\n\nReturn <em>the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees</em>. Since the answer may be too large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.\n\n",
