    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> array of <strong>distinct</strong> integers <code>nums</code>.\n\nThere is an element in <code>nums</code> that has the <strong>lowest</strong> value and an element that has the <strong>highest</strong> value. We call them the <strong>minimum</strong> and <strong>maximum</strong> respectively. Your goal is to remove <strong>both</strong> these elements from the array.\n\nA <strong>deletion</strong> is defined as either removing an element from the <strong>front</strong> of the array or removing an element from the <strong>back</strong> of the array.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of deletions it would take to remove <strong>both</strong> the minimum and maximum element from the array.</em>\n\n",
