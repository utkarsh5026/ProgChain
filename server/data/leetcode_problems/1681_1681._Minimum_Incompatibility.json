You are asked to distribute this array into <code>k</code> subsets of <strong>equal size</strong> such that there are no two equal elements in the same subset.\n\nA subset's <strong>incompatibility</strong> is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in that array.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum possible sum of incompatibilities</strong> of the </em><code>k</code> <em>subsets after distributing the array optimally, or return </em><code>-1</code><em> if it is not possible.</em>\n\nA subset is a group integers that appear in the array with no particular order.\n\n",
