You can divide each pile into any number of <strong>sub piles</strong>, but you <strong>cannot</strong> merge two piles together.\n\nYou are also given an integer <code>k</code>. You should allocate piles of candies to <code>k</code> children such that each child gets the <strong>same</strong> number of candies. Each child can take <strong>at most one</strong> pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum number of candies</strong> each child can get.</em>\n\n",
