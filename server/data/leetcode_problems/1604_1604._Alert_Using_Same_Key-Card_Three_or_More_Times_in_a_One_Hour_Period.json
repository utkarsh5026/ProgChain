    "description": "LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an <strong>alert</strong> if any worker uses the key-card <strong>three or more times</strong> in a one-hour period.\n\nYou are given a list of strings <code>keyName</code> and <code>keyTime</code> where <code>[keyName[i], keyTime[i]]</code> corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used <strong>in a</strong> <strong>single day</strong>.\n\nAccess times are given in the <strong>24-hour time format \"HH:MM\"</strong>, such as <code>\"23:51\"</code> and <code>\"09:49\"</code>.\n\nReturn a <em>list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use</em>. Sort the names in <strong>ascending order alphabetically</strong>.\n\nNotice that <code>\"10:00\"</code> - <code>\"11:00\"</code> is considered to be within a one-hour period, while <code>\"22:51\"</code> - <code>\"23:52\"</code> is not considered to be within a one-hour period.\n\n",
