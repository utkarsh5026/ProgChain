You are asked to construct a positive integer <code>n</code> that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nReturn <em>the number of nice divisors of</em> <code>n</code>. Since that number can be too large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nNote that a prime number is a natural number greater than <code>1</code> that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number <code>n</code> is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals <code>n</code>.\n\n",
