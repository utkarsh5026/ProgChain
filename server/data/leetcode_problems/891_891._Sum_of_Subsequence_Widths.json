    "description": "The <strong>width</strong> of a sequence is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sequence.\n\nGiven an array of integers <code>nums</code>, return <em>the sum of the <strong>widths</strong> of all the non-empty <strong>subsequences</strong> of </em><code>nums</code>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, <code>[3,6,2,7]</code> is a subsequence of the array <code>[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]</code>.\n\n",
