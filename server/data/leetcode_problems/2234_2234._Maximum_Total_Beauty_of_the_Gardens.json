    "description": "Alice is a caretaker of <code>n</code> gardens and she wants to plant flowers to maximize the total beauty of all her gardens.\n\nYou are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>flowers</code> of size <code>n</code>, where <code>flowers[i]</code> is the number of flowers already planted in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> garden. Flowers that are already planted <strong>cannot</strong> be removed. You are then given another integer <code>newFlowers</code>, which is the <strong>maximum</strong> number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers <code>target</code>, <code>full</code>, and <code>partial</code>.\n\nA garden is considered <strong>complete</strong> if it has <strong>at least</strong> <code>target</code> flowers. The <strong>total beauty</strong> of the gardens is then determined as the <strong>sum</strong> of the following:\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most </em><code>newFlowers</code><em> flowers.</em>\n\n",
