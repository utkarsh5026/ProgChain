    "description": "You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals <code>intervals</code> where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> represent the start and the end of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> interval and <code>intervals</code> is sorted in ascending order by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an interval <code>newInterval = [start, end]</code> that represents the start and end of another interval.\n\nInsert <code>newInterval</code> into <code>intervals</code> such that <code>intervals</code> is still sorted in ascending order by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>intervals</code> still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).\n\nReturn <code>intervals</code><em> after the insertion</em>.\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that you don't need to modify <code>intervals</code> in-place. You can make a new array and return it.\n\n",
