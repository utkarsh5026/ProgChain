    "description": "Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones <strong>arranged in a row</strong>, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array <code>stoneValue</code>.\n\nAlice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> stones from the <strong>first</strong> remaining stones in the row.\n\nThe score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is <code>0</code> initially.\n\nThe objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.\n\nAssume Alice and Bob <strong>play optimally</strong>.\n\nReturn <code>\"Alice\"</code><em> if Alice will win, </em><code>\"Bob\"</code><em> if Bob will win, or </em><code>\"Tie\"</code><em> if they will end the game with the same score</em>.\n\n",
