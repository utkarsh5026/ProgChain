    "description": "Given the <code>root</code> of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in <code>[low, high]</code>. Trimming the tree should <strong>not</strong> change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a <strong>unique answer</strong>.\n\nReturn <em>the root of the trimmed binary search tree</em>. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.\n\n",
