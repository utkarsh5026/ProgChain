You are given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.\n\nAt every node <code>i</code>, there is a gate.
