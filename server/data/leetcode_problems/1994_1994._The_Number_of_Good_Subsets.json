We call a subset of <code>nums</code> <strong>good</strong> if its product can be represented as a product of one or more <strong>distinct prime</strong> numbers.\n\nReturn <em>the number of different <strong>good</strong> subsets in </em><code>nums</code><em> <strong>modulo</strong> </em><code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nA <strong>subset</strong> of <code>nums</code> is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from <code>nums</code>. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.\n\n",
