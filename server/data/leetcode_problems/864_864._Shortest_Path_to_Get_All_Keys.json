You cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall.\n\nIf you walk over a key, you can pick it up and you cannot walk over a lock unless you have its corresponding key.\n\nFor some <code><font face=\"monospace\">1 &lt;= k &lt;= 6</font></code>, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first <code>k</code> letters of the English alphabet in the grid. This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.\n\nReturn <em>the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys</em>. If it is impossible, return <code>-1</code>.\n\n",
