    "description": "You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer <code>k</code>. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array <code>logs</code> where each <code>logs[i] = [ID<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the user with <code>ID<sub>i</sub></code> performed an action at the minute <code>time<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\n<strong>Multiple users</strong> can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform <strong>multiple actions</strong> in the same minute.\n\nThe <strong>user active minutes (UAM)</strong> for a given user is defined as the <strong>number of unique minutes</strong> in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.\n\nYou are to calculate a <strong>1-indexed</strong> array <code>answer</code> of size <code>k</code> such that, for each <code>j</code> (<code>1 &lt;= j &lt;= k</code>), <code>answer[j]</code> is the <strong>number of users</strong> whose <strong>UAM</strong> equals <code>j</code>.\n\nReturn <i>the array </i><code>answer</code><i> as described above</i>.\n\n",
