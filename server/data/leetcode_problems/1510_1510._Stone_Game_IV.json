    "description": "Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.\n\nInitially, there are <code>n</code> stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a <em>move</em> consisting of removing <strong>any</strong> non-zero <strong>square number</strong> of stones in the pile.\n\nAlso, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.\n\nGiven a positive integer <code>n</code>, return <code>true</code> if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return <code>false</code>, assuming both players play optimally.\n\n",
