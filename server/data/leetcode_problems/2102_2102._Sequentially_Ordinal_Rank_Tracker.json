    "description": "A scenic location is represented by its <code>name</code> and attractiveness <code>score</code>, where <code>name</code> is a <strong>unique</strong> string among all locations and <code>score</code> is an integer. Locations can be ranked from the best to the worst. The <strong>higher</strong> the score, the better the location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the <strong>lexicographically smaller</strong> name is better.\n\nYou are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports:\n\nNote that the test data are generated so that <strong>at any time</strong>, the number of queries <strong>does not exceed</strong> the number of locations added to the system.\n\nImplement the <code>SORTracker</code> class:\n\n",
