    "description": "A game on an <strong>undirected</strong> graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.\n\nThe graph is given as follows: <code>graph[a]</code> is a list of all nodes <code>b</code> such that <code>ab</code> is an edge of the graph.\n\nThe mouse starts at node <code>1</code> and goes first, the cat starts at node <code>2</code> and goes second, and there is a hole at node <code>0</code>.\n\nDuring each player's turn, they <strong>must</strong> travel along one&nbsp;edge of the graph that meets where they are.&nbsp; For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it <strong>must</strong> travel to any node in <code>graph[1]</code>.\n\nAdditionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node <code>0</code>).\n\nThen, the game can end in three&nbsp;ways:\n\nGiven a <code>graph</code>, and assuming both players play optimally, return\n\n",
