    "description": "There are <code>n</code> gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station is <code>gas[i]</code>.\n\nYou have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs <code>cost[i]</code> of gas to travel from the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> station to its next <code>(i + 1)<sup>th</sup></code> station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.\n\nGiven two integer arrays <code>gas</code> and <code>cost</code>, return <em>the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return</em> <code>-1</code>. If there exists a solution, it is <strong>guaranteed</strong> to be <strong>unique</strong>.\n\n",
