    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>8 x 8</code> grid <code>board</code>, where <code>board[r][c]</code> represents the cell <code>(r, c)</code> on a game board. On the board, free cells are represented by <code>'.'</code>, white cells are represented by <code>'W'</code>, and black cells are represented by <code>'B'</code>.\n\nEach move in this game consists of choosing a free cell and changing it to the color you are playing as (either white or black). However, a move is only <strong>legal</strong> if, after changing it, the cell becomes the <strong>endpoint of a good line</strong> (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).\n\nA <strong>good line</strong> is a line of <strong>three or more cells (including the endpoints)</strong> where the endpoints of the line are <strong>one color</strong>, and the remaining cells in the middle are the <strong>opposite color</strong> (no cells in the line are free). You can find examples for good lines in the figure below:\n\nGiven two integers <code>rMove</code> and <code>cMove</code> and a character <code>color</code> representing the color you are playing as (white or black), return <code>true</code> <em>if changing cell </em><code>(rMove, cMove)</code> <em>to color</em> <code>color</code> <em>is a <strong>legal</strong> move, or </em><code>false</code><em> if it is not legal</em>.\n\n",
