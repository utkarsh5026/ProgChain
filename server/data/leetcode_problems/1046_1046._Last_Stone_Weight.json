On each turn, we choose the <strong>heaviest two stones</strong> and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with <code>x &lt;= y</code>. The result of this smash is:\n\nAt the end of the game, there is <strong>at most one</strong> stone left.\n\nReturn <em>the weight of the last remaining stone</em>. If there are no stones left, return <code>0</code>.\n\n",
