    "description": "Given an <code>m x n</code> grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of <code>grid[i][j]</code> can be:\n\nNotice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.\n\nYou will initially start at the upper left cell <code>(0, 0)</code>. A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell <code>(0, 0)</code> and ends at the bottom-right cell <code>(m - 1, n - 1)</code> following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.\n\nYou can modify the sign on a cell with <code>cost = 1</code>. You can modify the sign on a cell <strong>one time only</strong>.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path</em>.\n\n",
