    "description": "You are given two strings <code>sentence1</code> and <code>sentence2</code>, each representing a <strong>sentence</strong> composed of words. A sentence is a list of <strong>words</strong> that are separated by a <strong>single</strong> space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of only uppercase and lowercase English characters.\n\nTwo sentences <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> are considered <strong>similar</strong> if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence (<em>possibly empty</em>) inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. <strong>Note</strong> that the inserted sentence must be separated from existing words by spaces.\n\nFor example,\n\nGiven two sentences <code>sentence1</code> and <code>sentence2</code>, return <strong>true</strong> if <code>sentence1</code> and <code>sentence2</code> are <strong>similar</strong>. Otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.\n\n",
