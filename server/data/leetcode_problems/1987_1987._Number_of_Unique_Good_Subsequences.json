    "description": "You are given a binary string <code>binary</code>. A <strong>subsequence</strong> of <code>binary</code> is considered <strong>good</strong> if it is <strong>not empty</strong> and has <strong>no leading zeros</strong> (with the exception of <code>\"0\"</code>).\n\nFind the number of <strong>unique good subsequences</strong> of <code>binary</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the number of <strong>unique good subsequences</strong> of </em><code>binary</code>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nA <strong>subsequence</strong> is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n",
