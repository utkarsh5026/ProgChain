    "description": "On day <code>1</code>, one person discovers a secret.\n\nYou are given an integer <code>delay</code>, which means that each person will <strong>share</strong> the secret with a new person <strong>every day</strong>, starting from <code>delay</code> days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer <code>forget</code>, which means that each person will <strong>forget</strong> the secret <code>forget</code> days after discovering it. A person <strong>cannot</strong> share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.\n\nGiven an integer <code>n</code>, return<em> the number of people who know the secret at the end of day </em><code>n</code>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
