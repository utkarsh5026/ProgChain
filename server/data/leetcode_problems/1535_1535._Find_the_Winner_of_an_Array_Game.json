    "description": "Given an integer array <code>arr</code> of <strong>distinct</strong> integers and an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nA game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. <code>arr[0]</code> and <code>arr[1]</code>). In each round of the game, we compare <code>arr[0]</code> with <code>arr[1]</code>, the larger integer wins and remains at position <code>0</code>, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins <code>k</code> consecutive rounds.\n\nReturn <em>the integer which will win the game</em>.\n\nIt is <strong>guaranteed</strong> that there will be a winner of the game.\n\n",
