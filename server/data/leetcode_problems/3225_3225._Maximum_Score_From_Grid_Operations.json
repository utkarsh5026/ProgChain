    "description": "You are given a 2D matrix <code>grid</code> of size <code>n x n</code>. Initially, all cells of the grid are colored white. In one operation, you can select any cell of indices <code>(i, j)</code>, and color black all the cells of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> column starting from the top row down to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> row.\n\nThe grid score is the sum of all <code>grid[i][j]</code> such that cell <code>(i, j)</code> is white and it has a horizontally adjacent black cell.\n\nReturn the <strong>maximum</strong> score that can be achieved after some number of operations.\n\n",
