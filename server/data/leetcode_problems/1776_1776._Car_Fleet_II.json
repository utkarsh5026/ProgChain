    "description": "There are <code>n</code> cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array <code>cars</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>cars[i] = [position<sub>i</sub>, speed<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents:\n\nFor simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the <strong>slowest</strong> car in the fleet.\n\nReturn an array <code>answer</code>, where <code>answer[i]</code> is the time, in seconds, at which the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car collides with the next car, or <code>-1</code> if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answers are accepted.\n\n",
