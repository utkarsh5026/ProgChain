The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being <code>(0, 1)</code>, the second couple being <code>(2, 3)</code>, and so on with the last couple being <code>(2n - 2, 2n - 1)</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side</em>. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.\n\n",
