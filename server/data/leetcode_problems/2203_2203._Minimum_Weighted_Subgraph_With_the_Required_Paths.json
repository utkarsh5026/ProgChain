    "description": "You are given an integer <code>n</code> denoting the number of nodes of a <strong>weighted directed</strong> graph. The nodes are numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[i] = [from<sub>i</sub>, to<sub>i</sub>, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists a <strong>directed</strong> edge from <code>from<sub>i</sub></code> to <code>to<sub>i</sub></code> with weight <code>weight<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nLastly, you are given three <strong>distinct</strong> integers <code>src1</code>, <code>src2</code>, and <code>dest</code> denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum weight</strong> of a subgraph of the graph such that it is <strong>possible</strong> to reach</em> <code>dest</code> <em>from both</em> <code>src1</code> <em>and</em> <code>src2</code> <em>via a set of edges of this subgraph</em>. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return <code>-1</code>.\n\nA <strong>subgraph</strong> is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The <strong>weight</strong> of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.\n\n",
