    "description": "A <strong>peak</strong> element in a 2D grid is an element that is <strong>strictly greater</strong> than all of its <strong>adjacent </strong>neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.\n\nGiven a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m x n</code> matrix <code>mat</code> where <strong>no two adjacent cells are equal</strong>, find <strong>any</strong> peak element <code>mat[i][j]</code> and return <em>the length 2 array </em><code>[i,j]</code>.\n\nYou may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an <strong>outer perimeter</strong> with the value <code>-1</code> in each cell.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in <code>O(m log(n))</code> or <code>O(n log(m))</code> time.\n\n",
