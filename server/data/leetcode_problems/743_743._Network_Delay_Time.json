    "description": "You are given a network of <code>n</code> nodes, labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You are also given <code>times</code>, a list of travel times as directed edges <code>times[i] = (u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>)</code>, where <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> is the source node, <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> is the target node, and <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.\n\nWe will send a signal from a given node <code>k</code>. Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> time it takes for all the</em> <code>n</code> <em>nodes to receive the signal</em>. If it is impossible for all the <code>n</code> nodes to receive the signal, return <code>-1</code>.\n\n",
