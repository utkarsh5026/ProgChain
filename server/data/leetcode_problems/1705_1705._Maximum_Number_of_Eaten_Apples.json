    "description": "There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for <code>n</code> days. On the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day, the tree grows <code>apples[i]</code> apples that will rot after <code>days[i]</code> days, that is on day <code>i + days[i]</code> the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by <code>apples[i] == 0</code> and <code>days[i] == 0</code>.\n\nYou decided to eat <strong>at most</strong> one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first <code>n</code> days.\n\nGiven two integer arrays <code>days</code> and <code>apples</code> of length <code>n</code>, return <em>the maximum number of apples you can eat.</em>\n\n",
