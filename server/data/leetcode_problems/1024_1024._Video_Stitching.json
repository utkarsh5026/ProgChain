    "description": "You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted <code>time</code> seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.\n\nEach video clip is described by an array <code>clips</code> where <code>clips[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the ith clip started at <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> and ended at <code>end<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nWe can cut these clips into segments freely.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event</em> <code>[0, time]</code>. If the task is impossible, return <code>-1</code>.\n\n",
