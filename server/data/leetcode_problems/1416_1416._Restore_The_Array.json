    "description": "A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits <code>s</code> and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range <code>[1, k]</code> and there are no leading zeros in the array.\n\nGiven the string <code>s</code> and the integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as </em><code>s</code><em> using the mentioned program</em>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
