    "description": "You are entering a competition, and are given two <strong>positive</strong> integers <code>initialEnergy</code> and <code>initialExperience</code> denoting your initial energy and initial experience respectively.\n\nYou are also given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>energy</code> and <code>experience</code>, both of length <code>n</code>.\n\nYou will face <code>n</code> opponents <strong>in order</strong>. The energy and experience of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> opponent is denoted by <code>energy[i]</code> and <code>experience[i]</code> respectively. When you face an opponent, you need to have both <strong>strictly</strong> greater experience and energy to defeat them and move to the next opponent if available.\n\nDefeating the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> opponent <strong>increases</strong> your experience by <code>experience[i]</code>, but <strong>decreases</strong> your energy by <code>energy[i]</code>.\n\nBefore starting the competition, you can train for some number of hours. After each hour of training, you can <strong>either</strong> choose to increase your initial experience by one, or increase your initial energy by one.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of training hours required to defeat all </em><code>n</code><em> opponents</em>.\n\n",
