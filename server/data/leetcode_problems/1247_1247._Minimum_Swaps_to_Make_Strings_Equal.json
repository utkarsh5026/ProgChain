    "description": "You are given two strings <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> of equal length consisting of letters <code>\"x\"</code> and <code>\"y\"</code> <strong>only</strong>. Your task is to make these two strings equal to each other. You can swap any two characters that belong to <strong>different</strong> strings, which means: swap <code>s1[i]</code> and <code>s2[j]</code>.\n\nReturn the minimum number of swaps required to make <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> equal, or return <code>-1</code> if it is impossible to do so.\n\n",
