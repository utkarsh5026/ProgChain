You are also given a single integer <code>money</code>, which represents your initial amount of money.\n\nYou must buy <strong>exactly</strong> two chocolates in such a way that you still have some <strong>non-negative</strong> leftover money. You would like to minimize the sum of the prices of the two chocolates you buy.\n\nReturn <em>the amount of money you will have leftover after buying the two chocolates</em>. If there is no way for you to buy two chocolates without ending up in debt, return <code>money</code>. Note that the leftover must be non-negative.\n\n",
