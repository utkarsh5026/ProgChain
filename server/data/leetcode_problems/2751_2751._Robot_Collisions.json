    "description": "There are <code>n</code> <strong>1-indexed</strong> robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.\n\nYou are given <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>positions</code>, <code>healths</code>, and a string <code>directions</code> (<code>directions[i]</code> is either <strong>'L'</strong> for <strong>left</strong> or <strong>'R'</strong> for <strong>right</strong>). All integers in <code>positions</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.\n\nAll robots start moving on the line<strong> simultaneously</strong> at the <strong>same speed </strong>in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will <strong>collide</strong>.\n\nIf two robots collide, the robot with <strong>lower health</strong> is <strong>removed</strong> from the line, and the health of the other robot <strong>decreases</strong> <strong>by one</strong>. The surviving robot continues in the <strong>same</strong> direction it was going. If both robots have the <strong>same</strong> health, they are both<strong> </strong>removed from the line.\n\nYour task is to determine the <strong>health</strong> of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same <strong>order </strong>that the robots were given,<strong> </strong>i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.\n\nReturn <em>an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.</em>\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> The positions may be unsorted.\n\n",
