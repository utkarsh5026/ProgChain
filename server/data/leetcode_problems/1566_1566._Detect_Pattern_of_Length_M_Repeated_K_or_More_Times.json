    "description": "Given an array of positive integers <code>arr</code>, find a pattern of length <code>m</code> that is repeated <code>k</code> or more times.\n\nA <strong>pattern</strong> is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times <strong>consecutively </strong>without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.\n\nReturn <code>true</code> <em>if there exists a pattern of length</em> <code>m</code> <em>that is repeated</em> <code>k</code> <em>or more times, otherwise return</em> <code>false</code>.\n\n",
