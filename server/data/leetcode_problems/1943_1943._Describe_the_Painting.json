    "description": "There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a <strong>unique</strong> color. You are given a 2D integer array <code>segments</code>, where <code>segments[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>, color<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the <strong>half-closed segment</strong> <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)</code> with <code>color<sub>i</sub></code> as the color.\n\nThe colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were <strong>mixed</strong> when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a <strong>set</strong> of mixed colors.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, you should only output the <strong>sum</strong> of the elements in the set rather than the full set.\n\nYou want to <strong>describe</strong> the painting with the <strong>minimum</strong> number of non-overlapping <strong>half-closed segments</strong> of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array <code>painting</code> where <code>painting[j] = [left<sub>j</sub>, right<sub>j</sub>, mix<sub>j</sub>]</code> describes a <strong>half-closed segment</strong> <code>[left<sub>j</sub>, right<sub>j</sub>)</code> with the mixed color <strong>sum</strong> of <code>mix<sub>j</sub></code>.\n\nReturn <em>the 2D array </em><code>painting</code><em> describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are <strong>not </strong>painted). You may return the segments in <strong>any order</strong></em>.\n\nA <strong>half-closed segment</strong> <code>[a, b)</code> is the section of the number line between points <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> <strong>including</strong> point <code>a</code> and <strong>not including</strong> point <code>b</code>.\n\n",
