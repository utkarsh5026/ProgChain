    "description": "You are given a directed graph with <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>, where each node has <strong>exactly one</strong> outgoing edge.\n\nThe graph is represented by a given <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>edges[i]</code> indicates that there is a <strong>directed</strong> edge from node <code>i</code> to node <code>edges[i]</code>.\n\nThe <strong>edge score</strong> of a node <code>i</code> is defined as the sum of the <strong>labels</strong> of all the nodes that have an edge pointing to <code>i</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the node with the highest <strong>edge score</strong></em>. If multiple nodes have the same <strong>edge score</strong>, return the node with the <strong>smallest</strong> index.\n\n",
