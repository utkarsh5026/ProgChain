All the objects in each&nbsp;of the two inputs arrays will contain an&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;field that has an integer value.&nbsp;\n\n<code>joinedArray</code>&nbsp;is an array formed by merging&nbsp;<code>arr1</code> and <code>arr2</code> based on&nbsp;their <code>id</code>&nbsp;key. The length of&nbsp;<code>joinedArray</code> should be the length of unique values of <code>id</code>. The returned array should be sorted in&nbsp;<strong>ascending</strong>&nbsp;order based on the <code>id</code>&nbsp;key.\n\nIf a given&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;exists in one array but not the other, the single object with that&nbsp;<code>id</code> should be included in the result array without modification.\n\nIf two objects share an <code>id</code>, their properties should be merged into a single&nbsp;object:\n\n",
