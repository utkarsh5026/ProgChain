    "description": "You are given an integer <code>n</code>. There is an <strong>undirected</strong> graph with <code>n</code> vertices, numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You are given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists an <strong>undirected</strong> edge connecting vertices <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nReturn <em>the number of <strong>complete connected components</strong> of the graph</em>.\n\nA <strong>connected component</strong> is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.\n\nA connected component is said to be <b>complete</b> if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.\n\n",
