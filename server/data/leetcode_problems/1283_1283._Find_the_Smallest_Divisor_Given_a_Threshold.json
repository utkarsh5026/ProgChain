    "description": "Given an array of integers <code>nums</code> and an integer <code>threshold</code>, we will choose a positive integer <code>divisor</code>, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the <strong>smallest</strong> <code>divisor</code> such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to <code>threshold</code>.\n\nEach result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: <code>7/3 = 3</code> and <code>10/2 = 5</code>).\n\nThe test cases are generated so&nbsp;that there will be an answer.\n\n",
