    "description": "There is a city composed of <code>n x n</code> blocks, where each block contains a single building shaped like a vertical square prism. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>n x n</code> integer matrix <code>grid</code> where <code>grid[r][c]</code> represents the <strong>height</strong> of the building located in the block at row <code>r</code> and column <code>c</code>.\n\nA city's <strong>skyline</strong> is the&nbsp;outer contour formed by all the building when viewing the side of the city from a distance. The <strong>skyline</strong> from each cardinal direction north, east, south, and west may be different.\n\nWe are allowed to increase the height of <strong>any number of buildings by any amount</strong> (the amount can be different per building). The height of a <code>0</code>-height building can also be increased. However, increasing the height of a building should <strong>not</strong> affect the city's <strong>skyline</strong> from any cardinal direction.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum total sum</strong> that the height of the buildings can be increased by <strong>without</strong> changing the city's <strong>skyline</strong> from any cardinal direction</em>.\n\n",
