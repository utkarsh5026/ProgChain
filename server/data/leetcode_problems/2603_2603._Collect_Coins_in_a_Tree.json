    "description": "There exists an undirected and unrooted tree with <code>n</code> nodes indexed from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You are given an integer <code>n</code> and a 2D integer array edges of length <code>n - 1</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree. You are also given&nbsp;an array <code>coins</code> of size <code>n</code> where <code>coins[i]</code> can be either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, where <code>1</code> indicates the presence of a coin in the vertex <code>i</code>.\n\nInitially, you choose to start at any vertex in&nbsp;the tree.&nbsp;Then, you can perform&nbsp;the following operations any number of times:&nbsp;\n\nFind <em>the minimum number of edges you need to go through to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex</em>.\n\nNote that if you pass an edge several times, you need to count it into the answer several times.\n\n",
