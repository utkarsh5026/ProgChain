    "description": "You are given a 2D integer array <code>intervals</code> where <code>intervals[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the <strong>inclusive</strong> interval <code>[left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code>.\n\nYou have to divide the intervals into one or more <strong>groups</strong> such that each interval is in <strong>exactly</strong> one group, and no two intervals that are in the same group <strong>intersect</strong> each other.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of groups you need to make</em>.\n\nTwo intervals <strong>intersect</strong> if there is at least one common number between them. For example, the intervals <code>[1, 5]</code> and <code>[5, 8]</code> intersect.\n\n",
