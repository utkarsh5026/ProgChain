    "description": "You are playing a game involving a <strong>circular</strong> array of non-zero integers <code>nums</code>. Each <code>nums[i]</code> denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index <code>i</code>:\n\nSince the array is <strong>circular</strong>, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.\n\nA <strong>cycle</strong> in the array consists of a sequence of indices <code>seq</code> of length <code>k</code> where:\n\nReturn <code>true</code><em> if there is a <strong>cycle</strong> in </em><code>nums</code><em>, or </em><code>false</code><em> otherwise</em>.\n\n",
