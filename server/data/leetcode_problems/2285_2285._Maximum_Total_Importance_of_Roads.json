    "description": "You are given an integer <code>n</code> denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array <code>roads</code> where <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists a <strong>bidirectional</strong> road connecting cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.\n\nYou need to assign each city with an integer value from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>, where each value can only be used <strong>once</strong>. The <strong>importance</strong> of a road is then defined as the <strong>sum</strong> of the values of the two cities it connects.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum total importance</strong> of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.</em>\n\n",
