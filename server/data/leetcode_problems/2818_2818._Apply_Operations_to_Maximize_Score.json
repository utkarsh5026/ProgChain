    "description": "You are given an array <code>nums</code> of <code>n</code> positive integers and an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nInitially, you start with a score of <code>1</code>. You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most <code>k</code> times:\n\nHere, <code>nums[l, ..., r]</code> denotes the subarray of <code>nums</code> starting at index <code>l</code> and ending at the index <code>r</code>, both ends being inclusive.\n\nThe <strong>prime score</strong> of an integer <code>x</code> is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of <code>x</code>. For example, the prime score of <code>300</code> is <code>3</code> since <code>300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum possible score</strong> after applying at most </em><code>k</code><em> operations</em>.\n\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo <code>10<sup>9 </sup>+ 7</code>.\n\n",
