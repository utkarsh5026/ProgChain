    "description": "You are given <code>n</code> balloons, indexed from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array <code>nums</code>. You are asked to burst all the balloons.\n\nIf you burst the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> balloon, you will get <code>nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]</code> coins. If <code>i - 1</code> or <code>i + 1</code> goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a <code>1</code> painted on it.\n\nReturn <em>the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely</em>.\n\n",
