    "description": "You are given an array of integers <code>stones</code> where <code>stones[i]</code> is the weight of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> stone.\n\nWe are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with <code>x &lt;= y</code>. The result of this smash is:\n\nAt the end of the game, there is <strong>at most one</strong> stone left.\n\nReturn <em>the smallest possible weight of the left stone</em>. If there are no stones left, return <code>0</code>.\n\n",
