    "description": "You are given two integers <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> representing a <strong>0-indexed</strong> <code>m x n</code> grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays <code>guards</code> and <code>walls</code> where <code>guards[i] = [row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>]</code> and <code>walls[j] = [row<sub>j</sub>, col<sub>j</sub>]</code> represent the positions of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> guard and <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> wall respectively.\n\nA guard can see <b>every</b> cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless <strong>obstructed</strong> by a wall or another guard. A cell is <strong>guarded</strong> if there is <strong>at least</strong> one guard that can see it.\n\nReturn<em> the number of unoccupied cells that are <strong>not</strong> <strong>guarded</strong>.</em>\n\n",
