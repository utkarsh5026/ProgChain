    "description": "You are given an <code>m x n</code> matrix <code>maze</code> (<strong>0-indexed</strong>) with empty cells (represented as <code>'.'</code>) and walls (represented as <code>'+'</code>). You are also given the <code>entrance</code> of the maze, where <code>entrance = [entrance<sub>row</sub>, entrance<sub>col</sub>]</code> denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.\n\nIn one step, you can move one cell <strong>up</strong>, <strong>down</strong>, <strong>left</strong>, or <strong>right</strong>. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the <strong>nearest exit</strong> from the <code>entrance</code>. An <strong>exit</strong> is defined as an <strong>empty cell</strong> that is at the <strong>border</strong> of the <code>maze</code>. The <code>entrance</code> <strong>does not count</strong> as an exit.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>number of steps</strong> in the shortest path from the </em><code>entrance</code><em> to the nearest exit, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if no such path exists</em>.\n\n",
