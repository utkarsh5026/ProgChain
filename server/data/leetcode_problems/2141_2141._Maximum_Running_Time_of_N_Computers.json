    "description": "You have <code>n</code> computers. You are given the integer <code>n</code> and a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>batteries</code> where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> battery can <strong>run</strong> a computer for <code>batteries[i]</code> minutes. You are interested in running <strong>all</strong> <code>n</code> computers <strong>simultaneously</strong> using the given batteries.\n\nInitially, you can insert <strong>at most one battery</strong> into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery <strong>any number of times</strong>. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.\n\nNote that the batteries cannot be recharged.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of minutes you can run all the </em><code>n</code><em> computers simultaneously.</em>\n\n",
