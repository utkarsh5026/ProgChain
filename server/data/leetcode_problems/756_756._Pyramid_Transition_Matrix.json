    "description": "You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains <strong>one less block</strong> than the row beneath it and is centered on top.\n\nTo make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific <strong>triangular patterns</strong> that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a <strong>single block</strong> stacked on top of <strong>two blocks</strong>. The patterns are given&nbsp;as a list of&nbsp;three-letter strings <code>allowed</code>, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.\n\nYou start with a bottom row of blocks <code>bottom</code>, given as a single string, that you <strong>must</strong> use as the base of the pyramid.\n\nGiven <code>bottom</code> and <code>allowed</code>, return <code>true</code><em> if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that <strong>every triangular pattern</strong> in the pyramid is in </em><code>allowed</code><em>, or </em><code>false</code><em> otherwise</em>.\n\n",
