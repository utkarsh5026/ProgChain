    "description": "A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in <strong>non-decreasing order</strong> by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array <code>expected</code> where <code>expected[i]</code> is the expected height of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student in line.\n\nYou are given an integer array <code>heights</code> representing the <strong>current order</strong> that the students are standing in. Each <code>heights[i]</code> is the height of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student in line (<strong>0-indexed</strong>).\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>number of indices</strong> where </em><code>heights[i] != expected[i]</code>.\n\n",
