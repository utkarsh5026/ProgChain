    "description": "Given an array of characters <code>chars</code>, compress it using the following algorithm:\n\nBegin with an empty string <code>s</code>. For each group of <strong>consecutive repeating characters</strong> in <code>chars</code>:\n\nThe compressed string <code>s</code> <strong>should not be returned separately</strong>, but instead, be stored <strong>in the input character array <code>chars</code></strong>. Note that group lengths that are <code>10</code> or longer will be split into multiple characters in <code>chars</code>.\n\nAfter you are done <strong>modifying the input array,</strong> return <em>the new length of the array</em>.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.\n\n",
