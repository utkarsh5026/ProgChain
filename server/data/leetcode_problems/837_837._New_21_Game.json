    "description": "Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game <strong>\"21\"</strong>.\n\nAlice starts with <code>0</code> points and draws numbers while she has less than <code>k</code> points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range <code>[1, maxPts]</code>, where <code>maxPts</code> is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.\n\nAlice stops drawing numbers when she gets <code>k</code> <strong>or more points</strong>.\n\nReturn the probability that Alice has <code>n</code> or fewer points.\n\nAnswers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer are considered accepted.\n\n",
