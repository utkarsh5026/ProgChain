    "description": "You are given an array of <code>events</code> where <code>events[i] = [startDay<sub>i</sub>, endDay<sub>i</sub>, value<sub>i</sub>]</code>. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> event starts at <code>startDay<sub>i</sub></code><sub> </sub>and ends at <code>endDay<sub>i</sub></code>, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of <code>value<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an integer <code>k</code> which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.\n\nYou can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the <strong>entire</strong> event. Note that the end day is <strong>inclusive</strong>: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum sum</strong> of values that you can receive by attending events.</em>\n\n",
