    "description": "There is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of <code>batchSize</code>. They have a rule where they must serve <strong>all</strong> of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer <code>batchSize</code> and an integer array <code>groups</code>, where <code>groups[i]</code> denotes that there is a group of <code>groups[i]</code> customers that will visit the shop. Each customer will get exactly one donut.\n\nWhen a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before serving any of the following groups. A group will be happy if they all get fresh donuts. That is, the first customer of the group does not receive a donut that was left over from the previous group.\n\nYou can freely rearrange the ordering of the groups. Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> possible number of happy groups after rearranging the groups.</em>\n\n",
