    "description": "You are given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree where each node has a value <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.\n\nFor all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return <em>the sum of these numbers</em>.\n\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a <strong>32-bits</strong> integer.\n\n",
