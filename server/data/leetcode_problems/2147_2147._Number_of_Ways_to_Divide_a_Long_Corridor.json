    "description": "Along a long library corridor, there is a line of seats and decorative plants. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>corridor</code> of length <code>n</code> consisting of letters <code>'S'</code> and <code>'P'</code> where each <code>'S'</code> represents a seat and each <code>'P'</code> represents a plant.\n\nOne room divider has <strong>already</strong> been installed to the left of index <code>0</code>, and <strong>another</strong> to the right of index <code>n - 1</code>. Additional room dividers can be installed. For each position between indices <code>i - 1</code> and <code>i</code> (<code>1 &lt;= i &lt;= n - 1</code>), at most one divider can be installed.\n\nDivide the corridor into non-overlapping sections, where each section has <strong>exactly two seats</strong> with any number of plants. There may be multiple ways to perform the division. Two ways are <strong>different</strong> if there is a position with a room divider installed in the first way but not in the second way.\n\nReturn <em>the number of ways to divide the corridor</em>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>. If there is no way, return <code>0</code>.\n\n",
