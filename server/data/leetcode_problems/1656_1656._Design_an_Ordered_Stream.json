    "description": "There is a stream of <code>n</code> <code>(idKey, value)</code> pairs arriving in an <strong>arbitrary</strong> order, where <code>idKey</code> is an integer between <code>1</code> and <code>n</code> and <code>value</code> is a string. No two pairs have the same <code>id</code>.\n\nDesign a stream that returns the values in <strong>increasing order of their IDs</strong> by returning a <strong>chunk</strong> (list) of values after each insertion. The concatenation of all the <strong>chunks</strong> should result in a list of the sorted values.\n\nImplement the <code>OrderedStream</code> class:\n\n",
