    "description": "You are given an <code>8 x 8</code> <strong>matrix</strong> representing a chessboard. There is <strong>exactly one</strong> white rook represented by <code>'R'</code>, some number of white bishops <code>'B'</code>, and some number of black pawns <code>'p'</code>. Empty squares are represented by <code>'.'</code>.\n\nA rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically (up, down, left, right) until it reaches another piece <em>or</em> the edge of the board. A rook is <strong>attacking</strong> a pawn if it can move to the pawn's square in one move.\n\nNote: A rook cannot move through other pieces, such as bishops or pawns. This means a rook cannot attack a pawn if there is another piece blocking the path.\n\nReturn the <strong>number of pawns</strong> the white rook is <strong>attacking</strong>.\n\n",
