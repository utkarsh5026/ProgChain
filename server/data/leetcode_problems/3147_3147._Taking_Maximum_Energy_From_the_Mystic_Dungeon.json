    "description": "In a mystic dungeon, <code>n</code> magicians are standing in a line. Each magician has an attribute that gives you energy. Some magicians can give you negative energy, which means taking energy from you.\n\nYou have been cursed in such a way that after absorbing energy from magician <code>i</code>, you will be instantly transported to magician <code>(i + k)</code>. This process will be repeated until you reach the magician where <code>(i + k)</code> does not exist.\n\nIn other words, you will choose a starting point and then teleport with <code>k</code> jumps until you reach the end of the magicians' sequence, <strong>absorbing all the energy</strong> during the journey.\n\nYou are given an array <code>energy</code> and an integer <code>k</code>. Return the <strong>maximum</strong> possible energy you can gain.\n\n",
