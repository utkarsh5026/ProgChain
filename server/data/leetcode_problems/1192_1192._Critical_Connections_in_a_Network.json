    "description": "There are <code>n</code> servers numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> connected by undirected server-to-server <code>connections</code> forming a network where <code>connections[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a connection between servers <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.\n\nA <em>critical connection</em> is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.\n\nReturn all critical connections in the network in any order.\n\n",
