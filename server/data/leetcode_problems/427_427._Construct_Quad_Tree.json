    "description": "Given a <code>n * n</code> matrix <code>grid</code> of <code>0's</code> and <code>1's</code> only. We want to represent <code>grid</code> with a Quad-Tree.\n\nReturn <em>the root of the Quad-Tree representing </em><code>grid</code>.\n\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree\">wiki</a>.\n\n<strong>Quad-Tree format:</strong>\n\nYou don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where <code>null</code> signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\n\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list <code>[isLeaf, val]</code>.\n\nIf the value of <code>isLeaf</code> or <code>val</code> is True we represent it as <strong>1</strong> in the list <code>[isLeaf, val]</code> and if the value of <code>isLeaf</code> or <code>val</code> is False we represent it as <strong>0</strong>.\n\n",
