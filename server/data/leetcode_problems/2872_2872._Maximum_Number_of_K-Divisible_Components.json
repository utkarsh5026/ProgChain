    "description": "There is an undirected tree with <code>n</code> nodes labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You are given the integer <code>n</code> and a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> of length <code>n - 1</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the tree.\n\nYou are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>values</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>values[i]</code> is the <strong>value</strong> associated with the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> node, and an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nA <strong>valid split</strong> of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges, possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have values that are divisible by <code>k</code>, where the <strong>value of a connected component</strong> is the sum of the values of its nodes.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum number of components</strong> in any valid split</em>.\n\n",
