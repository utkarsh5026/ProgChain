    "description": "Given two positive integers <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> represented as strings, find the count of <strong>stepping numbers</strong> in the inclusive range <code>[low, high]</code>.\n\nA <strong>stepping number</strong> is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of <strong>exactly</strong> <code>1</code>.\n\nReturn <em>an integer denoting the count of stepping numbers in the inclusive range</em> <code>[low, high]</code><em>. </em>\n\nSince the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n<strong>Note:</strong> A stepping number should not have a leading zero.\n\n",
