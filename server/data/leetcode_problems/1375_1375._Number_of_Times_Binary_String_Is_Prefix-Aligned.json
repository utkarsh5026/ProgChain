    "description": "You have a <strong>1-indexed</strong> binary string of length <code>n</code> where all the bits are <code>0</code> initially. We will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>) one by one. You are given a <strong>1-indexed</strong> integer array <code>flips</code> where <code>flips[i]</code> indicates that the bit at index <code>i</code> will be flipped in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> step.\n\nA binary string is <strong>prefix-aligned</strong> if, after the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> step, all the bits in the <strong>inclusive</strong> range <code>[1, i]</code> are ones and all the other bits are zeros.\n\nReturn <em>the number of times the binary string is <strong>prefix-aligned</strong> during the flipping process</em>.\n\n",
