    "description": "You are given an array <code>arr</code> which consists of only zeros and ones, divide the array into <strong>three non-empty parts</strong> such that all of these parts represent the same binary value.\n\nIf it is possible, return any <code>[i, j]</code> with <code>i + 1 &lt; j</code>, such that:\n\nIf it is not possible, return <code>[-1, -1]</code>.\n\nNote that the entire part is used when considering what binary value it represents. For example, <code>[1,1,0]</code> represents <code>6</code> in decimal, not <code>3</code>. Also, leading zeros <strong>are allowed</strong>, so <code>[0,1,1]</code> and <code>[1,1]</code> represent the same value.\n\n",
