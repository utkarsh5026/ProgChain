    "description": "You are given a list of bombs. The <strong>range</strong> of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a <strong>circle</strong> with the center as the location of the bomb.\n\nThe bombs are represented by a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>bombs</code> where <code>bombs[i] = [x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]</code>. <code>x<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>y<sub>i</sub></code> denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bomb, whereas <code>r<sub>i</sub></code> denotes the <strong>radius</strong> of its range.\n\nYou may choose to detonate a <strong>single</strong> bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate <strong>all bombs</strong> that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.\n\nGiven the list of <code>bombs</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate <strong>only one</strong> bomb</em>.\n\n",
