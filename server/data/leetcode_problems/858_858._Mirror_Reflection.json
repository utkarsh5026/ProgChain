Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code>.\n\nThe square room has walls of length <code>p</code>&nbsp;and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance <code>q</code> from the <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> receptor.\n\nGiven the two integers <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>, return <em>the number of the receptor that the ray meets first</em>.\n\nThe test cases are guaranteed so that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.\n\n",
