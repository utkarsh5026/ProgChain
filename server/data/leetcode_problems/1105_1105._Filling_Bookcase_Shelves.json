    "description": "You are given an array <code>books</code> where <code>books[i] = [thickness<sub>i</sub>, height<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates the thickness and height of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> book. You are also given an integer <code>shelfWidth</code>.\n\nWe want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have a total width <code>shelfWidth</code>.\n\nWe choose some of the books to place on this shelf such that the sum of their thickness is less than or equal to <code>shelfWidth</code>, then build another level of the shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down. We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.\n\nNote that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner</em>.\n\n",
