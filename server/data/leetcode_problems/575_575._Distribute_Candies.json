    "description": "Alice has <code>n</code> candies, where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> candy is of type <code>candyType[i]</code>. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.\n\nThe doctor advised Alice to only eat <code>n / 2</code> of the candies she has (<code>n</code> is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.\n\nGiven the integer array <code>candyType</code> of length <code>n</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats </em><code>n / 2</code><em> of them</em>.\n\n",
