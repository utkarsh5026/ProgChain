    "description": "You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given <code>heights</code>, a 2D array of size <code>rows x columns</code>, where <code>heights[row][col]</code> represents the height of cell <code>(row, col)</code>. You are situated in the top-left cell, <code>(0, 0)</code>, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, <code>(rows-1, columns-1)</code> (i.e.,&nbsp;<strong>0-indexed</strong>). You can move <strong>up</strong>, <strong>down</strong>, <strong>left</strong>, or <strong>right</strong>, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum <strong>effort</strong>.\n\nA route's <strong>effort</strong> is the <strong>maximum absolute difference</strong><strong> </strong>in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum <strong>effort</strong> required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.</em>\n\n",
