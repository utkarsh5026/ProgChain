    "description": "You are given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> arrays of strings <code>startWords</code> and <code>targetWords</code>. Each string consists of <strong>lowercase English letters</strong> only.\n\nFor each string in <code>targetWords</code>, check if it is possible to choose a string from <code>startWords</code> and perform a <strong>conversion operation</strong> on it to be equal to that from <code>targetWords</code>.\n\nThe <strong>conversion operation</strong> is described in the following two steps:\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>number of strings</strong> in </em><code>targetWords</code><em> that can be obtained by performing the operations on <strong>any</strong> string of </em><code>startWords</code>.\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that you will only be verifying if the string in <code>targetWords</code> can be obtained from a string in <code>startWords</code> by performing the operations. The strings in <code>startWords</code> <strong>do not</strong> actually change during this process.\n\n",
