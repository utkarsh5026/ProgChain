    "description": "A sentence is a list of <strong>tokens</strong> separated by a <strong>single</strong> space with no leading or trailing spaces. Every token is either a <strong>positive number</strong> consisting of digits <code>0-9</code> with no leading zeros, or a <strong>word</strong> consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nGiven a string <code>s</code> representing a sentence, you need to check if <strong>all</strong> the numbers in <code>s</code> are <strong>strictly increasing</strong> from left to right (i.e., other than the last number, <strong>each</strong> number is <strong>strictly smaller</strong> than the number on its <strong>right</strong> in <code>s</code>).\n\nReturn <code>true</code><em> if so, or </em><code>false</code><em> otherwise</em>.\n\n",
