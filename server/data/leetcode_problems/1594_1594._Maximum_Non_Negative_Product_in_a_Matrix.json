    "description": "You are given a <code>m x n</code> matrix <code>grid</code>. Initially, you are located at the top-left corner <code>(0, 0)</code>, and in each step, you can only <strong>move right or down</strong> in the matrix.\n\nAmong all possible paths starting from the top-left corner <code>(0, 0)</code> and ending in the bottom-right corner <code>(m - 1, n - 1)</code>, find the path with the <strong>maximum non-negative product</strong>. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.\n\nReturn the <em>maximum non-negative product <strong>modulo</strong> </em><code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>. <em>If the maximum product is <strong>negative</strong>, return </em><code>-1</code>.\n\nNotice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.\n\n",
