    "description": "You are given a <strong>tree</strong> (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) <strong>rooted</strong> at node <code>0</code> consisting of <code>n</code> nodes numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. The tree is represented by a <strong>0-indexed</strong> array <code>parent</code> of size <code>n</code>, where <code>parent[i]</code> is the parent of node <code>i</code>. Since node <code>0</code> is the root, <code>parent[0] == -1</code>.\n\nYou are also given a string <code>s</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>s[i]</code> is the character assigned to the edge between <code>i</code> and <code>parent[i]</code>. <code>s[0]</code> can be ignored.\n\nReturn <em>the number of pairs of nodes </em><code>(u, v)</code><em> such that </em><code>u &lt; v</code><em> and the characters assigned to edges on the path from </em><code>u</code><em> to </em><code>v</code><em> can be <strong>rearranged</strong> to form a <strong>palindrome</strong></em>.\n\nA string is a <strong>palindrome</strong> when it reads the same backwards as forwards.\n\n",
