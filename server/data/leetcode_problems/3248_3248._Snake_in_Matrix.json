    "description": "There is a snake in an <code>n x n</code> matrix <code>grid</code> and can move in <strong>four possible directions</strong>. Each cell in the <code>grid</code> is identified by the position: <code>grid[i][j] = (i * n) + j</code>.\n\nThe snake starts at cell 0 and follows a sequence of commands.\n\nYou are given an integer <code>n</code> representing the size of the <code>grid</code> and an array of strings <code>commands</code> where each <code>command[i]</code> is either <code>\"UP\"</code>, <code>\"RIGHT\"</code>, <code>\"DOWN\"</code>, and <code>\"LEFT\"</code>. It's guaranteed that the snake will remain within the <code>grid</code> boundaries throughout its movement.\n\nReturn the position of the final cell where the snake ends up after executing <code>commands</code>.\n\n",
