    "description": "You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a <strong>limit</strong> on the <strong>number of boxes</strong> and the <strong>total weight</strong> that it can carry.\n\nYou are given an array <code>boxes</code>, where <code>boxes[i] = [ports<sub>\u200b\u200bi</sub>\u200b, weight<sub>i</sub>]</code>, and three integers <code>portsCount</code>, <code>maxBoxes</code>, and <code>maxWeight</code>.\n\nThe boxes need to be delivered <strong>in the order they are given</strong>. The ship will follow these steps:\n\nThe ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of <strong>trips</strong> the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.</em>\n\n",
