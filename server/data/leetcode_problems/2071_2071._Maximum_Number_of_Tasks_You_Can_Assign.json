    "description": "You have <code>n</code> tasks and <code>m</code> workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>tasks</code>, with the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> task requiring <code>tasks[i]</code> strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>workers</code>, with the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> worker having <code>workers[j]</code> strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a <strong>single</strong> task and must have a strength <strong>greater than or equal</strong> to the task's strength requirement (i.e., <code>workers[j] &gt;= tasks[i]</code>).\n\nAdditionally, you have <code>pills</code> magical pills that will <strong>increase a worker's strength</strong> by <code>strength</code>. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker <strong>at most one</strong> magical pill.\n\nGiven the <strong>0-indexed </strong>integer arrays <code>tasks</code> and <code>workers</code> and the integers <code>pills</code> and <code>strength</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of tasks that can be completed.</em>\n\n",
