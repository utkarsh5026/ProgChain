    "description": "There is an <code>m x n</code> rectangular island that borders both the <strong>Pacific Ocean</strong> and <strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong>. The <strong>Pacific Ocean</strong> touches the island's left and top edges, and the <strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong> touches the island's right and bottom edges.\n\nThe island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an <code>m x n</code> integer matrix <code>heights</code> where <code>heights[r][c]</code> represents the <strong>height above sea level</strong> of the cell at coordinate <code>(r, c)</code>.\n\nThe island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is <strong>less than or equal to</strong> the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.\n\nReturn <em>a <strong>2D list</strong> of grid coordinates </em><code>result</code><em> where </em><code>result[i] = [r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>]</code><em> denotes that rain water can flow from cell </em><code>(r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)</code><em> to <strong>both</strong> the Pacific and Atlantic oceans</em>.\n\n",
