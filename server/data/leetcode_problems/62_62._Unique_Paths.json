    "description": "There is a robot on an <code>m x n</code> grid. The robot is initially located at the <strong>top-left corner</strong> (i.e., <code>grid[0][0]</code>). The robot tries to move to the <strong>bottom-right corner</strong> (i.e., <code>grid[m - 1][n - 1]</code>). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n\nGiven the two integers <code>m</code> and <code>n</code>, return <em>the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner</em>.\n\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to <code>2 * 10<sup>9</sup></code>.\n\n",
