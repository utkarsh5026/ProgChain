On each player's turn, they can <strong>remove</strong> a stone from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob may <strong>value the stones differently</strong>.\n\nYou are given two integer arrays of length <code>n</code>, <code>aliceValues</code> and <code>bobValues</code>. Each <code>aliceValues[i]</code> and <code>bobValues[i]</code> represents how Alice and Bob, respectively, value the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> stone.\n\nThe winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are chosen. If both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a draw. Both players will play <strong>optimally</strong>.&nbsp;Both players know the other's values.\n\nDetermine the result of the game, and:\n\n",
