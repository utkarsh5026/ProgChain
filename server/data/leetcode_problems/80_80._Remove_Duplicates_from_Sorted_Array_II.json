    "description": "Given an integer array <code>nums</code> sorted in <strong>non-decreasing order</strong>, remove some duplicates <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>in-place</strong></a> such that each unique element appears <strong>at most twice</strong>. The <strong>relative order</strong> of the elements should be kept the <strong>same</strong>.\n\nSince it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the <strong>first part</strong> of the array <code>nums</code>. More formally, if there are <code>k</code> elements after removing the duplicates, then the first <code>k</code> elements of <code>nums</code>&nbsp;should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first&nbsp;<code>k</code>&nbsp;elements.\n\nReturn <code>k</code><em> after placing the final result in the first </em><code>k</code><em> slots of </em><code>nums</code>.\n\nDo <strong>not</strong> allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by <strong>modifying the input array <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\">in-place</a></strong> with O(1) extra memory.\n\n<strong>Custom Judge:</strong>\n\nThe judge will test your solution with the following code:\n\nIf all assertions pass, then your solution will be <strong>accepted</strong>.\n\n",
