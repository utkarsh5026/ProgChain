    "description": "Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of <code>n</code> nodes and three types of edges:\n\nGiven an array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[i] = [type<sub>i</sub>, u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a bidirectional edge of type <code>type<sub>i</sub></code> between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.\n\nReturn <em>the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return</em> <code>-1</code> <em>if Alice and Bob cannot fully traverse the graph.</em>\n\n",
