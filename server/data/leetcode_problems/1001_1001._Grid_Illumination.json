    "description": "There is a 2D <code>grid</code> of size <code>n x n</code> where each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially <strong>turned off</strong>.\n\nYou are given a 2D array of lamp positions <code>lamps</code>, where <code>lamps[i] = [row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the lamp at <code>grid[row<sub>i</sub>][col<sub>i</sub>]</code> is <strong>turned on</strong>. Even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.\n\nWhen a lamp is turned on, it <strong>illuminates its cell</strong> and <strong>all other cells</strong> in the same <strong>row, column, or diagonal</strong>.\n\nYou are also given another 2D array <code>queries</code>, where <code>queries[j] = [row<sub>j</sub>, col<sub>j</sub>]</code>. For the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query, determine whether <code>grid[row<sub>j</sub>][col<sub>j</sub>]</code> is illuminated or not. After answering the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> query, <strong>turn off</strong> the lamp at <code>grid[row<sub>j</sub>][col<sub>j</sub>]</code> and its <strong>8 adjacent lamps</strong> if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with <code>grid[row<sub>j</sub>][col<sub>j</sub>]</code>.\n\nReturn <em>an array of integers </em><code>ans</code><em>,</em><em> where </em><code>ans[j]</code><em> should be </em><code>1</code><em> if the cell in the </em><code>j<sup>th</sup></code><em> query was illuminated, or </em><code>0</code><em> if the lamp was not.</em>\n\n",
