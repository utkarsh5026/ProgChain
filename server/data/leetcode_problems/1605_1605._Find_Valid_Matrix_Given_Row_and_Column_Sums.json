    "description": "You are given two arrays <code>rowSum</code> and <code>colSum</code> of non-negative integers where <code>rowSum[i]</code> is the sum of the elements in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> row and <code>colSum[j]</code> is the sum of the elements of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.\n\nFind any matrix of <strong>non-negative</strong> integers of size <code>rowSum.length x colSum.length</code> that satisfies the <code>rowSum</code> and <code>colSum</code> requirements.\n\nReturn <em>a 2D array representing <strong>any</strong> matrix that fulfills the requirements</em>. It's guaranteed that <strong>at least one </strong>matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.\n\n",
