    "description": "You are given two string arrays <code>positive_feedback</code> and <code>negative_feedback</code>, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that <strong>no</strong> word is both positive and negative.\n\nInitially every student has <code>0</code> points. Each positive word in a feedback report <strong>increases</strong> the points of a student by <code>3</code>, whereas each negative word <strong>decreases</strong> the points by <code>1</code>.\n\nYou are given <code>n</code> feedback reports, represented by a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string array <code>report</code>&nbsp;and a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>student_id</code>, where <code>student_id[i]</code> represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report <code>report[i]</code>. The ID of each student is <strong>unique</strong>.\n\nGiven an integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the top </em><code>k</code><em> students after ranking them in <strong>non-increasing</strong> order by their points</em>. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.\n\n",
