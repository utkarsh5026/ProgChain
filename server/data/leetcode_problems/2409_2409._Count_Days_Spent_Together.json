    "description": "Alice and Bob are traveling to Rome for separate business meetings.\n\nYou are given 4 strings <code>arriveAlice</code>, <code>leaveAlice</code>, <code>arriveBob</code>, and <code>leaveBob</code>. Alice will be in the city from the dates <code>arriveAlice</code> to <code>leaveAlice</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>), while Bob will be in the city from the dates <code>arriveBob</code> to <code>leaveBob</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>). Each will be a 5-character string in the format <code>\"MM-DD\"</code>, corresponding to the month and day of the date.\n\nReturn<em> the total number of days that Alice and Bob are in Rome together.</em>\n\nYou can assume that all dates occur in the <strong>same</strong> calendar year, which is <strong>not</strong> a leap year. Note that the number of days per month can be represented as: <code>[31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]</code>.\n\n",
