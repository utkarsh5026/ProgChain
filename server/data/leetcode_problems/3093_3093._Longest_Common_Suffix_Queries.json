If there are two or more strings in <code>wordsContainer</code> that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the <strong>smallest</strong> in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the <strong>same</strong> smallest length, find the one that occurred <strong>earlier</strong> in <code>wordsContainer</code>.\n\nReturn <em>an array of integers </em><code>ans</code><em>, where </em><code>ans[i]</code><em> is the index of the string in </em><code>wordsContainer</code><em> that has the <strong>longest common suffix</strong> with </em><code>wordsQuery[i]</code><em>.</em>\n\n",
