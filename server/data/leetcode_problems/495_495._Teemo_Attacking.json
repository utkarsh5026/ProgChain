    "description": "Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly <code>duration</code> seconds. More formally, an attack at second <code>t</code> will mean Ashe is poisoned during the <strong>inclusive</strong> time interval <code>[t, t + duration - 1]</code>. If Teemo attacks again <strong>before</strong> the poison effect ends, the timer for it is <strong>reset</strong>, and the poison effect will end <code>duration</code> seconds after the new attack.\n\nYou are given a <strong>non-decreasing</strong> integer array <code>timeSeries</code>, where <code>timeSeries[i]</code> denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second <code>timeSeries[i]</code>, and an integer <code>duration</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>total</strong> number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned</em>.\n\n",
