    "description": "Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array <code>paths</code>, where <code>paths[i]</code> is an array representing an absolute path to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> folder in the file system.\n\nTwo folders (not necessarily on the same level) are <strong>identical</strong> if they contain the <strong>same non-empty</strong> set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders <strong>do not</strong> need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are <strong>identical</strong>, then <strong>mark</strong> the folders as well as all their subfolders.\n\nOnce all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will <strong>delete</strong> all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.\n\nReturn <em>the 2D array </em><code>ans</code> <em>containing the paths of the <strong>remaining</strong> folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in <strong>any</strong> order</em>.\n\n",
