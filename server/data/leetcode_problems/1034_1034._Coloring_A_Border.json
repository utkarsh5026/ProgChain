    "description": "You are given an <code>m x n</code> integer matrix <code>grid</code>, and three integers <code>row</code>, <code>col</code>, and <code>color</code>. Each value in the grid represents the color of the grid square at that location.\n\nTwo squares are called <strong>adjacent</strong> if they are next to each other in any of the 4 directions.\n\nTwo squares belong to the same <strong>connected component</strong> if they have the same color and they are adjacent.\n\nThe <strong>border of a connected component</strong> is all the squares in the connected component that are either adjacent to (at least) a square not in the component, or on the boundary of the grid (the first or last row or column).\n\nYou should color the <strong>border</strong> of the <strong>connected component</strong> that contains the square <code>grid[row][col]</code> with <code>color</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the final grid</em>.\n\n",
