The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person is counted in year <code>x</code>'s population if <code>x</code> is in the <strong>inclusive</strong> range <code>[birth<sub>i</sub>, death<sub>i</sub> - 1]</code>. Note that the person is <strong>not</strong> counted in the year that they die.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>earliest</strong> year with the <strong>maximum population</strong></em>.\n\n",
