If there is no cycle, return </em><code>null</code>.\n\nThere is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the <code>next</code> pointer. Internally, <code>pos</code> is used to denote the index of the node that tail's <code>next</code> pointer is connected to (<strong>0-indexed</strong>). It is <code>-1</code> if there is no cycle. <strong>Note that</strong> <code>pos</code> <strong>is not passed as a parameter</strong>.\n\n<strong>Do not modify</strong> the linked list.\n\n",
