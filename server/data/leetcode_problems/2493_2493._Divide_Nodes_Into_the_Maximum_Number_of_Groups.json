    "description": "You are given a positive integer <code>n</code> representing the number of nodes in an <strong>undirected</strong> graph. The nodes are labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.\n\nYou are also given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code>, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i, </sub>b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a <strong>bidirectional</strong> edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. <strong>Notice</strong> that the given graph may be disconnected.\n\nDivide the nodes of the graph into <code>m</code> groups (<strong>1-indexed</strong>) such that:\n\nReturn <em>the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum </em><code>m</code><em>) into which you can divide the nodes</em>. Return <code>-1</code> <em>if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions</em>.\n\n",
