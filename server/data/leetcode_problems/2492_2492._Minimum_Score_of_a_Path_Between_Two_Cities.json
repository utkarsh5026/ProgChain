You are also given a <strong>2D</strong> array <code>roads</code> where <code>roads[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>, distance<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is a <strong>bidirectional </strong>road between cities <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> with a distance equal to <code>distance<sub>i</sub></code>. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.\n\nThe <strong>score</strong> of a path between two cities is defined as the <strong>minimum </strong>distance of a road in this path.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum </strong>possible score of a path between cities </em><code>1</code><em> and </em><code>n</code>.\n\n<strong>Note</strong>:\n\n",
