    "description": "You are given two lists of closed intervals, <code>firstList</code> and <code>secondList</code>, where <code>firstList[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> and <code>secondList[j] = [start<sub>j</sub>, end<sub>j</sub>]</code>. Each list of intervals is pairwise <strong>disjoint</strong> and in <strong>sorted order</strong>.\n\nReturn <em>the intersection of these two interval lists</em>.\n\nA <strong>closed interval</strong> <code>[a, b]</code> (with <code>a &lt;= b</code>) denotes the set of real numbers <code>x</code> with <code>a &lt;= x &lt;= b</code>.\n\nThe <strong>intersection</strong> of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of <code>[1, 3]</code> and <code>[2, 4]</code> is <code>[2, 3]</code>.\n\n",
