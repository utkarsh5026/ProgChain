    "description": "You are given a 2D integer array <code>stockPrices</code> where <code>stockPrices[i] = [day<sub>i</sub>, price<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates the price of the stock on day <code>day<sub>i</sub></code> is <code>price<sub>i</sub></code>. A <strong>line chart</strong> is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum number of lines</strong> needed to represent the line chart</em>.\n\n",
