    "description": "You are given a floating-point number <code>hour</code>, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take <code>n</code> trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array <code>dist</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>dist[i]</code> describes the distance (in kilometers) of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> train ride.\n\nEach train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum positive integer</strong> speed <strong>(in kilometers per hour)</strong> that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or </em><code>-1</code><em> if it is impossible to be on time</em>.\n\nTests are generated such that the answer will not exceed <code>10<sup>7</sup></code> and <code>hour</code> will have <strong>at most two digits after the decimal point</strong>.\n\n",
