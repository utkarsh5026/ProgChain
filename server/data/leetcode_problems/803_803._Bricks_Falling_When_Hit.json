    "description": "You are given an <code>m x n</code> binary <code>grid</code>, where each <code>1</code> represents a brick and <code>0</code> represents an empty space. A brick is <strong>stable</strong> if:\n\nYou are also given an array <code>hits</code>, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location <code>hits[i] = (row<sub>i</sub>, col<sub>i</sub>)</code>. The brick on that location&nbsp;(if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will <strong>fall</strong>. Once a brick falls, it is <strong>immediately</strong> erased from the <code>grid</code> (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).\n\nReturn <em>an array </em><code>result</code><em>, where each </em><code>result[i]</code><em> is the number of bricks that will <strong>fall</strong> after the </em><code>i<sup>th</sup></code><em> erasure is applied.</em>\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.\n\n",
