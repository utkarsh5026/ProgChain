    "description": "You are given an <code>m x n</code> integer matrix <code>points</code> (<strong>0-indexed</strong>). Starting with <code>0</code> points, you want to <strong>maximize</strong> the number of points you can get from the matrix.\n\nTo gain points, you must pick one cell in <strong>each row</strong>. Picking the cell at coordinates <code>(r, c)</code> will <strong>add</strong> <code>points[r][c]</code> to your score.\n\nHowever, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows <code>r</code> and <code>r + 1</code> (where <code>0 &lt;= r &lt; m - 1</code>), picking cells at coordinates <code>(r, c<sub>1</sub>)</code> and <code>(r + 1, c<sub>2</sub>)</code> will <strong>subtract</strong> <code>abs(c<sub>1</sub> - c<sub>2</sub>)</code> from your score.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of points you can achieve</em>.\n\n<code>abs(x)</code> is defined as:\n\n",
