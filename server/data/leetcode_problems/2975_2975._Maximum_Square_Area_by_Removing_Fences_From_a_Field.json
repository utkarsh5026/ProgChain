    "description": "There is a large <code>(m - 1) x (n - 1)</code> rectangular field with corners at <code>(1, 1)</code> and <code>(m, n)</code> containing some horizontal and vertical fences given in arrays <code>hFences</code> and <code>vFences</code> respectively.\n\nHorizontal fences are from the coordinates <code>(hFences[i], 1)</code> to <code>(hFences[i], n)</code> and vertical fences are from the coordinates <code>(1, vFences[i])</code> to <code>(m, vFences[i])</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> area of a <strong>square</strong> field that can be formed by <strong>removing</strong> some fences (<strong>possibly none</strong>) or </em><code>-1</code> <em>if it is impossible to make a square field</em>.\n\nSince the answer may be large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9 </sup>+ 7</code>.\n\n<strong>Note: </strong>The field is surrounded by two horizontal fences from the coordinates <code>(1, 1)</code> to <code>(1, n)</code> and <code>(m, 1)</code> to <code>(m, n)</code> and two vertical fences from the coordinates <code>(1, 1)</code> to <code>(m, 1)</code> and <code>(1, n)</code> to <code>(m, n)</code>. These fences <strong>cannot</strong> be removed.\n\n",
