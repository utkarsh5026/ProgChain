(i.e., the&nbsp;length of the garden is <code>n</code>).\n\nThere are <code>n + 1</code> taps located at points <code>[0, 1, ..., n]</code> in the garden.\n\nGiven an integer <code>n</code> and an integer array <code>ranges</code> of length <code>n + 1</code> where <code>ranges[i]</code> (0-indexed) means the <code>i-th</code> tap can water the area <code>[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]</code> if it was open.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum number of taps</em> that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return <strong>-1</strong>.\n\n",
