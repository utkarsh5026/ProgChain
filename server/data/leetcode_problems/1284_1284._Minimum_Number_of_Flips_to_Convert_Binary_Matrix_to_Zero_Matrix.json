    "description": "Given a <code>m x n</code> binary matrix <code>mat</code>. In one step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbors of it if they exist (Flip is changing <code>1</code> to <code>0</code> and <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>). A pair of cells are called neighbors if they share one edge.\n\nReturn the <em>minimum number of steps</em> required to convert <code>mat</code> to a zero matrix or <code>-1</code> if you cannot.\n\nA <strong>binary matrix</strong> is a matrix with all cells equal to <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> only.\n\nA <strong>zero matrix</strong> is a matrix with all cells equal to <code>0</code>.\n\n",
