    "description": "You are given a positive integer <strong>0-indexed</strong>&nbsp;array <code>nums</code>.\n\nA subset of the array <code>nums</code> is <strong>square-free</strong> if the product of its elements is a <strong>square-free integer</strong>.\n\nA <strong>square-free integer</strong> is an integer that is divisible by no square number other than <code>1</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the number of square-free non-empty subsets of the array</em> <strong>nums</strong>. Since the answer may be too large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nA <strong>non-empty</strong>&nbsp;<strong>subset</strong> of <code>nums</code> is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none but not all) elements from <code>nums</code>. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.\n\n",
