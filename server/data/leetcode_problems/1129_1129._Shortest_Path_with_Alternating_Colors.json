    "description": "You are given an integer <code>n</code>, the number of nodes in a directed graph where the nodes are labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. Each edge is red or blue in this graph, and there could be self-edges and parallel edges.\n\nYou are given two arrays <code>redEdges</code> and <code>blueEdges</code> where:\n\nReturn an array <code>answer</code> of length <code>n</code>, where each <code>answer[x]</code> is the length of the shortest path from node <code>0</code> to node <code>x</code> such that the edge colors alternate along the path, or <code>-1</code> if such a path does not exist.\n\n",
