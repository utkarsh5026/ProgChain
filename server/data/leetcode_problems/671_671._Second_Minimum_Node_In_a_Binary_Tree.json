    "description": "Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly <code>two</code> or <code>zero</code> sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property&nbsp;<code>root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)</code>&nbsp;always holds.\n\nGiven such a binary tree, you need to output the <b>second minimum</b> value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.\n\nIf no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.\n\n",
