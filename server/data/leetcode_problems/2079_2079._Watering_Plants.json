    "description": "You want to water <code>n</code> plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> from left to right where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plant is located at <code>x = i</code>. There is a river at <code>x = -1</code> that you can refill your watering can at.\n\nEach plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:\n\nYou are initially at the river (i.e., <code>x = -1</code>). It takes <strong>one step</strong> to move <strong>one unit</strong> on the x-axis.\n\nGiven a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>plants</code> of <code>n</code> integers, where <code>plants[i]</code> is the amount of water the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> plant needs, and an integer <code>capacity</code> representing the watering can capacity, return <em>the <strong>number of steps</strong> needed to water all the plants</em>.\n\n",
