    "description": "You are given two <strong>positive</strong> integers <code>startPos</code> and <code>endPos</code>. Initially, you are standing at position <code>startPos</code> on an <strong>infinite</strong> number line. With one step, you can move either one position to the left, or one position to the right.\n\nGiven a positive integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the number of <strong>different</strong> ways to reach the position </em><code>endPos</code><em> starting from </em><code>startPos</code><em>, such that you perform <strong>exactly</strong> </em><code>k</code><em> steps</em>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\nTwo ways are considered different if the order of the steps made is not exactly the same.\n\n<strong>Note</strong> that the number line includes negative integers.\n\n",
