    "description": "You are given a 2D integer array <code>ranges</code> where <code>ranges[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that all integers between <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>end<sub>i</sub></code> (both <strong>inclusive</strong>) are contained in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> range.\n\nYou are to split <code>ranges</code> into <strong>two</strong> (possibly empty) groups such that:\n\nTwo ranges are said to be <strong>overlapping</strong>&nbsp;if there exists at least <strong>one</strong> integer that is present in both ranges.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>total number</strong> of ways to split</em> <code>ranges</code> <em>into two groups</em>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
