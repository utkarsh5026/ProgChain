    "description": "In the \"100 game\" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>. The player who first causes the running total to <strong>reach or exceed</strong> 100 wins.\n\nWhat if we change the game so that players <strong>cannot</strong> re-use integers?\n\nFor example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total &gt;= 100.\n\nGiven two integers <code>maxChoosableInteger</code> and <code>desiredTotal</code>, return <code>true</code> if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return <code>false</code>. Assume both players play <strong>optimally</strong>.\n\n",
