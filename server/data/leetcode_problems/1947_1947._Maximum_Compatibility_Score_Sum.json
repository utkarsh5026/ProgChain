    "description": "There is a survey that consists of <code>n</code> questions where each question's answer is either <code>0</code> (no) or <code>1</code> (yes).\n\nThe survey was given to <code>m</code> students numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>m - 1</code> and <code>m</code> mentors numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>m - 1</code>. The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array <code>students</code> where <code>students[i]</code> is an integer array that contains the answers of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student (<strong>0-indexed</strong>). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array <code>mentors</code> where <code>mentors[j]</code> is an integer array that contains the answers of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> mentor (<strong>0-indexed</strong>).\n\nEach student will be assigned to <strong>one</strong> mentor, and each mentor will have <strong>one</strong> student assigned to them. The <strong>compatibility score</strong> of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.\n\nYou are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to <strong>maximize</strong> the<strong> sum of the compatibility scores</strong>.\n\nGiven <code>students</code> and <code>mentors</code>, return <em>the <strong>maximum compatibility score sum</strong> that can be achieved.</em>\n\n",
