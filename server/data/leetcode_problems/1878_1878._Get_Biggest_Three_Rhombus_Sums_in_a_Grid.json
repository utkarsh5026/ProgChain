    "description": "You are given an <code>m x n</code> integer matrix <code>grid</code>\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nA <strong>rhombus sum</strong> is the sum of the elements that form <strong>the</strong> <strong>border</strong> of a regular rhombus shape in <code>grid</code>\u200b\u200b\u200b. The rhombus must have the shape of a square rotated 45 degrees with each of the corners centered in a grid cell. Below is an image of four valid rhombus shapes with the corresponding colored cells that should be included in each <strong>rhombus sum</strong>:\n\nNote that the rhombus can have an area of 0, which is depicted by the purple rhombus in the bottom right corner.\n\nReturn <em>the biggest three <strong>distinct rhombus sums</strong> in the </em><code>grid</code><em> in <strong>descending order</strong></em><em>. If there are less than three distinct values, return all of them</em>.\n\n",
