    "description": "You are given an integer array <code>jobs</code>, where <code>jobs[i]</code> is the amount of time it takes to complete the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job.\n\nThere are <code>k</code> workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to <strong>exactly</strong> one worker. The <strong>working time</strong> of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the <strong>maximum working time</strong> of any worker is <strong>minimized</strong>.\n\n<em>Return the <strong>minimum</strong> possible <strong>maximum working time</strong> of any assignment. </em>\n\n",
