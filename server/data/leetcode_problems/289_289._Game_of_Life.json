Each cell interacts with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood\" target=\"_blank\">eight neighbors</a> (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\n<span>The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the <code>m x n</code> grid <code>board</code>, return <em>the next state</em>.</span>\n\n",
