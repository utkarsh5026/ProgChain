    "description": "There are some prizes on the <strong>X-axis</strong>. You are given an integer array <code>prizePositions</code> that is <strong>sorted in non-decreasing order</strong>, where <code>prizePositions[i]</code> is the position of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> prize. There could be different prizes at the same position on the line. You are also given an integer <code>k</code>.\n\nYou are allowed to select two segments with integer endpoints. The length of each segment must be <code>k</code>. You will collect all prizes whose position falls within at least one of the two selected segments (including the endpoints of the segments). The two selected segments may intersect.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of prizes you can win if you choose the two segments optimally</em>.\n\n",
