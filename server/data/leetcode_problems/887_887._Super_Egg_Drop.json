    "description": "You are given <code>k</code> identical eggs and you have access to a building with <code>n</code> floors labeled from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.\n\nYou know that there exists a floor <code>f</code> where <code>0 &lt;= f &lt;= n</code> such that any egg dropped at a floor <strong>higher</strong> than <code>f</code> will <strong>break</strong>, and any egg dropped <strong>at or below</strong> floor <code>f</code> will <strong>not break</strong>.\n\nEach move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor <code>x</code> (where <code>1 &lt;= x &lt;= n</code>). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may <strong>reuse</strong> it in future moves.\n\nReturn <em>the <strong>minimum number of moves</strong> that you need to determine <strong>with certainty</strong> what the value of </em><code>f</code> is.\n\n",
