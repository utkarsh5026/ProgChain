    "description": "You are given a string <code>word</code> that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.\n\nYou will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, <code>\"a123bc34d8ef34\"</code> will become <code>\" 123&nbsp; 34 8&nbsp; 34\"</code>. Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: <code>\"123\"</code>, <code>\"34\"</code>, <code>\"8\"</code>, and <code>\"34\"</code>.\n\nReturn <em>the number of <strong>different</strong> integers after performing the replacement operations on </em><code>word</code>.\n\nTwo integers are considered different if their decimal representations <strong>without any leading zeros</strong> are different.\n\n",
