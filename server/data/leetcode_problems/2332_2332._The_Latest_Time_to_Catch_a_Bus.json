    "description": "You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>buses</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>buses[i]</code> represents the departure time of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bus. You are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>passengers</code> of length <code>m</code>, where <code>passengers[j]</code> represents the arrival time of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> passenger. All bus departure times are unique. All passenger arrival times are unique.\n\nYou are given an integer <code>capacity</code>, which represents the <strong>maximum</strong> number of passengers that can get on each bus.\n\nWhen a passenger arrives, they will wait in line for the next available bus. You can get on a bus that departs at <code>x</code> minutes if you arrive at <code>y</code> minutes where <code>y &lt;= x</code>, and the bus is not full. Passengers with the <strong>earliest</strong> arrival times get on the bus first.\n\nMore formally when a bus arrives, either:\n\nReturn <em>the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus</em>. You <strong>cannot</strong> arrive at the same time as another passenger.\n\n<strong>Note: </strong>The arrays <code>buses</code> and <code>passengers</code> are not necessarily sorted.\n\n",
