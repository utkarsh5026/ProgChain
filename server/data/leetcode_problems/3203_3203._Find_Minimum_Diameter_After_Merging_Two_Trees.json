    "description": "There exist two <strong>undirected </strong>trees with <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> nodes, numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> and from <code>0</code> to <code>m - 1</code>, respectively. You are given two 2D integer arrays <code>edges1</code> and <code>edges2</code> of lengths <code>n - 1</code> and <code>m - 1</code>, respectively, where <code>edges1[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> in the first tree and <code>edges2[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that there is an edge between nodes <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> in the second tree.\n\nYou must connect one node from the first tree with another node from the second tree with an edge.\n\nReturn the <strong>minimum </strong>possible <strong>diameter </strong>of the resulting tree.\n\nThe <strong>diameter</strong> of a tree is the length of the <em>longest</em> path between any two nodes in the tree.\n\n",
