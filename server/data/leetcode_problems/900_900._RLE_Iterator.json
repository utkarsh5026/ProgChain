    "description": "We can use run-length encoding (i.e., <strong>RLE</strong>) to encode a sequence of integers. In a run-length encoded array of even length <code>encoding</code> (<strong>0-indexed</strong>), for all even <code>i</code>, <code>encoding[i]</code> tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value <code>encoding[i + 1]</code> is repeated in the sequence.\n\nGiven a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.\n\nImplement the <code>RLEIterator</code> class:\n\n",
