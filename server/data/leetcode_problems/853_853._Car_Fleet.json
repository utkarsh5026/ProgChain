    "description": "There are <code>n</code> cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile <code>target</code>.\n\nYou are given two integer array <code>position</code> and <code>speed</code>, both of length <code>n</code>, where <code>position[i]</code> is the starting mile of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car and <code>speed[i]</code> is the speed of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car in miles per hour.\n\nA car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.\n\nA <strong>car fleet</strong> is a car or cars driving next to each other. The speed of the car fleet is the <strong>minimum</strong> speed of any car in the fleet.\n\nIf a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile <code>target</code>, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.\n\nReturn the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.\n\n",
