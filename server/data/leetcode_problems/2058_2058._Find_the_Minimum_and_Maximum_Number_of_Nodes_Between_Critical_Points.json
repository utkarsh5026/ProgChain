    "description": "A <strong>critical point</strong> in a linked list is defined as <strong>either</strong> a <strong>local maxima</strong> or a <strong>local minima</strong>.\n\nA node is a <strong>local maxima</strong> if the current node has a value <strong>strictly greater</strong> than the previous node and the next node.\n\nA node is a <strong>local minima</strong> if the current node has a value <strong>strictly smaller</strong> than the previous node and the next node.\n\nNote that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists <strong>both</strong> a previous node and a next node.\n\nGiven a linked list <code>head</code>, return <em>an array of length 2 containing </em><code>[minDistance, maxDistance]</code><em> where </em><code>minDistance</code><em> is the <strong>minimum distance</strong> between <strong>any&nbsp;two distinct</strong> critical points and </em><code>maxDistance</code><em> is the <strong>maximum distance</strong> between <strong>any&nbsp;two distinct</strong> critical points. If there are <strong>fewer</strong> than two critical points, return </em><code>[-1, -1]</code>.\n\n",
