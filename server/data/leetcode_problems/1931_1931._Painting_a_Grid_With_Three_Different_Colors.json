    "description": "You are given two integers <code>m</code> and <code>n</code>. Consider an <code>m x n</code> grid where each cell is initially white. You can paint each cell <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, or <strong>blue</strong>. All cells <strong>must</strong> be painted.\n\nReturn<em> the number of ways to color the grid with <strong>no two adjacent cells having the same color</strong></em>. Since the answer can be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.\n\n",
