    "description": "There are <code>n</code> computers numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> connected by ethernet cables <code>connections</code> forming a network where <code>connections[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a connection between computers <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.\n\nYou are given an initial computer network <code>connections</code>. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.\n\nReturn <em>the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected</em>. If it is not possible, return <code>-1</code>.\n\n",
