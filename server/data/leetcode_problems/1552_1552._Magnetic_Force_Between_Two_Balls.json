Rick has <code>n</code> empty baskets, the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> basket is at <code>position[i]</code>, Morty has <code>m</code> balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the <strong>minimum magnetic force</strong> between any two balls is <strong>maximum</strong>.\n\nRick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is <code>|x - y|</code>.\n\nGiven the integer array <code>position</code> and the integer <code>m</code>. Return <em>the required force</em>.\n\n",
